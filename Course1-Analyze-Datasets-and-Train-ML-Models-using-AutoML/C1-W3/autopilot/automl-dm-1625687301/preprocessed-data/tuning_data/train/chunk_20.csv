1,This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?
0,This is a very cute shirt with great details. however  it runs a little bit small. not as full cut as it seems.
1,I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it's a great color  soft  flowy  fun  practical.
-1,Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
1,The fabric is thin  though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!
-1,"I'm a rather small person--5'2""  about 100 lbs  32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place  i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs  planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee  but even as petite as i am  i coul"
0,"This top fits like shown in the pictures. however  i bought the rose color and thought it was a little ""off"". would have loved to find the ivory in my size."
1,Super cute and comfy  perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.
0,This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time  thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it  the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.
0,Loved the design and print of this blouse.  however  every time i put it on or took it off  i could hear the seams ripping.  definitely wasn't because it was too small either.
-1,I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
-1,Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium  it was apparently not available in the medium  i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website  medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable  but really liked the dress.
-1,Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.
-1,I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great  and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious  soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition  the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it  then this morning went to have another look at it  wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this
-1,"I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7"" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price  it really should be cut better."
0,I loved the dog on this sweater  and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on  like others  i did find it to be itchy  but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are  so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...
1,I purchased the bright red color of this bandeau top. the color is vibrant and the overall style is very cute. unfortunately it made my chest look too big... but the quality is really nice and i'm sure it would look gorgeous on other body types.
0,Gorgeous  but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!
-1,Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite  way too much fabric. returned.
-1,"When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc"
0,I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.
-1,This item is huge. i'm normally a medium  sized down to a small  still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide  as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops  but this was a tent.
-1,This shirt is purportedly made of silk  but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.
1,Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.
0,I ordered my normal size 6 in this dress and could barely get it on. it runs very small. i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up.
1,"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"
1,I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace  for the weekend. i am 137 lbs  a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly.
1,"This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however  so i would caution that it may not be work ""office"" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses  it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or"
-1,It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady
1,Great  flattering fit  lovely light fabric  classy with an edge. getting another one the other color! stripes on the taupe one are navy -
0,If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.
-1,The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul
0,Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips  the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition  i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.
0,I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c
1,"These are the perfect vintage-looking high rise jeans  without the risk inherent in buying vintage. for reference  i am 5'2""  108 lbs and usually a 26 in ag. these fit me perfect in a size 26 and were a great length for booties and flats. they fit me at versus above the ankle."
0,This suit is so adorable! i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me. the suit is comfy  seems well made and fit nicely. but  although it fit technically  i don't like the way it cuts me off at the thigh. it's not flattering for me at all.     the suit is kind of a neoprene material  so it's thicker than a normal bathing suit  so i think even though it isn't lined  it might not be see-through  but i didn't get it wet to test it out. in terms of fit  i think it
0,I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed  but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!
0,I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice  sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender  the massive volume of fabric wouldn't matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note  this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri
-1,It was very pretty but it ran very big   sadly i had to return it.
0,"I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun  and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also  not as comfortable as they looked  the crotch seemed a little ""low"" on me  though the pants were in the correct size."
1,I absolutely love this pullover and am so glad i purchased it. it is the perfect weight for fall/winter  super soft  true to size. the diamond shape opening in back looks great with my strappy yoga bras  i have received compliments every time i wear it. i am 6'  144lb  slim/athletic build and often have trouble with sleeve length. this however is perfect & i can use the thumb holes as designed without stretching the sleeves in an awkward way. wish it came in more colors!
0,I ordered the petite in my size  since i'm well petite  but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately  for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits  but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.
0,"I wrote item ran large  but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10"" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice  but it does have some issues."
-1,Top opens in the middle right in front. should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return
0,Very well made  wonderful fabric. fit perfectly everywhere but the bust.
0,This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular  non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise  its a cute tunic style top.
1,This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!
1,Love this tee  purchased the blue and white  i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose. works good not fitting too tight. i like it because it's a tee shirt but it's a little dressy  great for going out to dinner  etc...
1,"I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable  beautiful fabric  cute gold buttons!  as well  due to the cut  it feels roomy  but has a slender fit around the arms.  the ""denim"" color has beautiful detail  but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!"
1,This dress is gorgeous! i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8  cause i'm not much for form fitted dresses. however  it was still pretty body con for me. i passed in it for now  but in the future i might try a 10 petite?? the color is a nice brick red with a textured whitish pattern. and it is soft ... like i wanted to snuggle up on the couch in it  but i had to refrain! i've been having bad luck with zippers from retailer dresses recently  but this one was smooth sailing and pretty too! the length wa
-1,This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress  even though i sized down.
0,I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(
-1,Disappointed :-( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.
1,Cute jacket  but size didn't work on me. 5'4  135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops  but m in jackets. ordered the medium  but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer  but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.
1,I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky  i love the back  how it ties  and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go  just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work...     reference: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
0,The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top  it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure  and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.
-1,I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however  i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans  the same  from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn't live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale  i was not happy with the quality.
0,Beautiful color and softness  very warm  but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.
0,Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife  but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
-1,I like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy. the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful  i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year. it has to go back though  just too large. i don't love it quite enough to order a size down.
-1,"I have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect  except it is going back. i am 5'9"" 150 lbs. medium is my normal top size  but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture. no buttons  so no way to close it. unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo. not worth the price."
-1,I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however  this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering  opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.
1,I purchased this top over the weekend and absolutely love it. i am currently 9 months pregnant (due in a week) and this top is perfect bc it has plenty of length. it is super soft and comfortable for the texas heat. i am 5'6'' usually 115 lbs currently closer to 140 lbs.
1,This is the softest jacket! i could sleep in this fabric. the ruched details and fun collar make it unique. plus it has inside pockets! one of the best finds in a while.
0,I love belted sweaters  but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
1,"I have a sillier style sweater from moth that i got last year and love. this is not as great  but i like the style so i will keep it. i knew the sleeves would be shorter  but wish they were made full length with a little less ""bat wing"". the color is close to as shown- maybe a little lighter. i was hoping for more of a navy since that is what they are calling it- but this is more of a denim blue."
-1,Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain  not as displayed.
-1,I try to find something to like about everything i buy  even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt  but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch
1,Ever since i saw this dress i fall for it totally love the pattern and the colors. i got the size l and the fabric is really good. once i tried it on tho it broke my heart the dress fit perfect everywhere but in the v neck... the design there is odd i believe is for small breast cup girls  im size c and let me tell you  it look horrible  i was very disappointed so dress its going back :(
1,It's a pretty dress  my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or  if you are a savvy sewer  you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6  but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.
1,Beautiful flowing feminine dress. runs large; size down. hot pink color. well made.
