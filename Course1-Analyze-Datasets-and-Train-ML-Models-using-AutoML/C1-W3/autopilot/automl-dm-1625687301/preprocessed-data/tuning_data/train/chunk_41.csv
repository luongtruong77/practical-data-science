0,It's a beautiful top  but not for the price. very thin material (not see-through though)  i fear it may easily rip.
0,This top is beautiful aesthetically  and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out  so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.  however  i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me  which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt  which looked nice. however  the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s
1,"Just bought this at the store. just to be safe  i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size. that was a good idea. ( i am a 38b  5'9""  and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts.) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest. when directly compared to the medium  it seems the major difference is the length-- the large was > 1"" longer than the medium. i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok."
1,The color is a very dark mustard yellow  thin/light-weight material  and it has a pretty feminine drape. 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt. cute cuffs (complementary design). the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips. all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in. i'm usually between a s/m  i recommend the size up for hip fit.
0,Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on  but can be worn in a versatile way  and if you are small chested  without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material  i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!
-1,This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.
1,I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult  but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.
1,"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab  keeps you warm or cool as appropriate  doesn't ride up  and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down  but once you do  you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age  middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes  and in this cami  i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more  but the later gives m"
1,"I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders  and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print  and it spelled disaster.    size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5"" tall  135 lbs  34d  35-29-37  narrow across shoulders  with short arms and long torso.    fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however  the sleeves didn't sl"
-1,I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all don't bother.
0,I thought this top was so pretty and airy  but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.
-1,I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer. it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom. so if you're expecting  this one would be great.
1,Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
0,I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however  each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings  i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally  the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall  if you are very careful  this is an amazing dress  but i did return it because of its delicate nature.
-1,Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.
0,"Beautiful detail  soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7"" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length."
1,I recently bought this blouse  the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!
-1,This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl
-1,I ordered a small  but it was way to big. it was very soft.
-1,"So i bought this  even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all  5""2. had to go back."
0,The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband  mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips  they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue  i would keep the trousers  as they are comfortable and pretty  and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through  as i feared.
0,Loved the style  ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders  boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy  fitted business slacks. midday  i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say  it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i
0,This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off  and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.
1,I adore this skirt - it is so soft and flowy. i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff  but it's not at all. the dots are soft as is the main fabric. i could wear this all day long and be very comfy. the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color. i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did- no pinch at the waist. i love that it's feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun. it is midi-length  as you see on the model. absolutely a great buy!
0,I love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic; however  the pockets ruin it  if that's possible. they make the dress bulky around the hips. i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium. i think this brand runs a little small. the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size. the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear. i love the subtle texture. one odd thing  the tag is attached to the stand-up collar. i had my hair up when i tried
0,Not for petite women  you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model. if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment.
0,This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
0,The fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me. sadly  it looked ridiculous on me. i wouldn't recommend the top for busty girls. it looked like a bell on me. fyi  it doesn't come with a camisole underneath.
-1,I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...
1,I was so excited for this to come in the mail  once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive  it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe
1,Purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding. can't say enough good things about it! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight. the style is slimming and flattering. although i am short  i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly. pants are very easy to hem if needed. needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate!
0,Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.
-1,Love the top  but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.
1,I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.
-1,The top is more of a cream color than an ivory. it's also a bit boxer than anticipated. fit is true to size.
-1,This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.
1,This is definitely my go to top for work  weekends or night out with the husband. i've worn it with skinny jeans  black tights and skirts. it goes with just about anything. easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece. i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo.
0,I ordered this quite nice cardigan. i received the sweater promptly (yay fast shipping!) but never received the belt to it. i tried emailing about it  but didn't get a response. the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesn't work. i hope to receive the belt soon  because i'd really like to wear this a lot this winter.
-1,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!
0,I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
1,I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts)  stay put  and wear very well. these are well worth the price.
-1,I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away  i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on. i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn't a hit for me.
-1,Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall  120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
-1,The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.
-1,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.
-1,I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps  but they did not feel or fit the same way at all. i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white. these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me. sadly  these will be going back.
0,Low waisted  weird liner.
0,I tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide. they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs  though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex. the stripes are really cute  the cut is just very strange.     for reference  the black and white is the small  the taupe is the xxs.
-1,"Wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors. i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman (i'm 5'3""  ordered a s)  this just looked like a nightgown on me. sorry to say it's going back."
1,"These cuff jeans are very good looking! 4 stars bc of price. they run small too. i wear 29 in pilcro for ref and these were best for me in a 31. the rise is very short so if you are tall  beware. i'm 5'9"" and the 29 i tried was super uncomfy in the crotch area. i haven't worn them all day yet so they might stretch a bit."
1,"I ordered these in the pinkish color  and i love them! i'm 5'8"" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer  but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini  bandeau  or even tankini. the price is great  especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative."
-1,"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style  but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level  retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh."
1,Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.   looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.     i love to wear with tan knee-high boots.
-1,This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small  very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust  maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.
1,Great pants. i'm 5'6 and about 130. the size 2 fit nice at the waist and loose in the thigh. they hit right at the ankle. the colors are nice/ muted. the details are great. overall great pants.
-1,This is a beautiful dress  but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style  but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.  i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty.
0,I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo
1,As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it  and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back  has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings  but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights  but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com
0,Cute top  not great on me. beautiful  bright color.
1,"This dress is perfect for the summer  very lightweight  has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting  so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6"" tall  but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly."
-1,"Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim  and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10"" and ordered a medium. also  it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway  i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning."
-1,I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes  i ordered a medium and it still ran small  i was very surprised. its was also disappointing
-1,"The shirt is beautiful  but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders  and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium  and the shirt didn't work in every direction."
0,"The dress is too big. i got size 4  after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7""  125 lb). it is too wide  not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady  but looks pathetic on me).     the pattern is too bright  much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately  it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.    the material is heavier than i expected."
1,I'm 5'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter  it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again  i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also  i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable  but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
1,So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
1,These fit quite well  and it's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight. great for spring or summer. fits tts.
0,I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde
1,Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!
0,This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.  i invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....  the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.  and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress  cocktail party or date night. the top de
