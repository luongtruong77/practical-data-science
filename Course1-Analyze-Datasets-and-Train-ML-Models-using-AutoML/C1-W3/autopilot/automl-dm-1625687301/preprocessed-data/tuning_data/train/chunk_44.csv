-1,I am a size 2 and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous  it looked like a pirate sack. it's unfortunately going back.
-1,These are a beautiful color  but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size  can't even imagine them being lower. also  they are cropped  that's hard to tell in the picture.
1,I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine  without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist  but it's still very flattering.
-1,"The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was ""ok"". just didn't love it."
1,This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall  a deep vivid blue color  and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway  but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price  it just wasn't right for me.
0,"I love this dress  but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8"" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small  but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on  but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work."
-1,This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big  but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.
0,I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite  but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up  it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.
1,I love the fit of this tee for everyday wear. it's forgiving on my late 30s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee. my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear. otherwise the fit  style  and fabric weight are great. it fits tts. i'm usually a size 4 and the small fits perfectly.
-1,Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.
0,"The design of this dress is darling and so unique  and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3"" and ordered the 2  and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that  but this one's going back. shame  too  because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut  but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high."
1,It was hard for me to rate how this was sized-it is tight through the bust  very baggy and boxy through the body  and short. looked gorgeous on the hanger though!
1,"Button down shirts usually aren't my thing  but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down  which is great! i am 5'4"" and small-framed  and the size 0 fits just right."
0,A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!
0,"I am normally a m-l (170 lbs  5'4""  34dd). i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big  and it is huge. seriously  i could wear it as a dress. i like the whole loose and comfy top thing  but this is so massive it looks sloppy. i'm going try and return it for a small. hey  i like that i can wear a small! the green color really is pretty  and it's so soft. just need a much smaller size."
1,"Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress. it definitely needs heels. i'm 5'4""  120#  34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff."
0,"This is as pretty in person as it is online  good quality (except one item i'll get to)  and fits true to size. i'm 5'6""  normally a medium/8  and the medium fit great in this top.  i almost kept this shirt...so close  i had it on a hanger  but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online  but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on  my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)..."
-1,"I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest  just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14  i am 5' 6"". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size."
1,This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).
-1,I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!
0,"Okay  i love the blouse this brand has in the same material  so i thought i'd delight in this dress. i am a 5'7"" hourglass but have a longer torso. i ordered the large in this  usually a 10 or 12 fits me.. but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist  and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid. the bust area was a little loose  and i'm a 36c. then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress.. and i love my"
1,The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture  it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans  or dressing down something fancier.
-1,I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.
-1,I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.
-1,This coat is awful  just awful. i bought it based on the reviews  my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat  it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear  but the look  style  and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!
0,"I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3"" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store."
1,I love retailer sweaters! always great quality and design  this one is no exception. i have the navy blue one and it fits well  true to size.
-1,After reading the previous review  i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today  and i was so disappointed. first of all  it's huge. the medium was way too big on me  and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second  the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo  and the fabric felt cheap. finally  it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.
1,I used to walk by this dress  thinking not much of it. but one day i realized it had a bow which im a complete sucker for. tried it on. fell in love. tried on the 4 and 6 - went with the 4  runs tts. if the dress is too large  the bow flips down and you can see too much gaping between your back and the dress. somewhere between a shift and a sheath is this silhouette. with my hair pinned up in a teased out japanese bun and great black heels  my valentine date fell for this dress too. he said it r
0,This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however  it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo  and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium.
-1,I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering  and really lightweight. the fabric  however  couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened  as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it.     such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
-1,Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain  not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand  this was just a quality control oversight i guess.
1,I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l  usually wear l/xl  i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i didn't like the fabric much  i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back  but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need 2 sizes up  it runs too small.
-1,For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words  i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
0,"I am 5' 10"" 135 lbs  normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact  the elastic is very loose  not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on  given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run"
-1,I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug
-1,I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort  it wasn't for me.
1,My mother  who is not a dress person  ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress  and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile  she decided to try it  and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images  but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully  and looks extremely elegant.
0,Super cute  flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
-1,This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall  a pretty horrible dress. save your money 
1,I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!
-1,This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously  it's bad.
0,"I ordered the geometric  blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately  it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting  bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference  i'm 5'4"" 120lbs 34 a."
0,Love the colors  love the design  and sure to keep you toasty. im usually a size 0 or 2 so i ordered an extra small- it felt a bit roomie
-1,"This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a ""life ""in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or i better say  it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately  it stretched more than a full size  and generally lost its shape. now  the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore."
-1,I ordered the dress on-line. this dress looked pretty  the material was soft and comfortable  the length was perfect  but the zipper was totally out of place. it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn. i had to return the dress. i normally don't see a problem at this level in retailer clothes.
1,Love the lattice inserts  makes it feel like you have ventilation which is nice on a hot summer day. i purchased this in grey and in xs. i normally wear m for a looser fit  s for a more fitted look  so i was really surprised that an xs worked for me and was fitted. i haven't worn it since i washed it though. decided to buy the white but in a small  pretty but very see thru. will need to wear a shirt underneath  a little bummed because i liked the breeze! one other comment  this shirt is long! wh
0,It is a cute top and i loved the fit and it's super soft feel  but i'm kind of getting tired of the sheer shirt thing this year. i bought this for the summer and it's hot here so not wanting to have to wear a shirt under my shirt. it's not crazy sheer  but still undecided. if you live in a state with no sweat  you'll probably be fine. :) i'll have to walk around and try it in different lighting situations and think about it?
1,I have two tracy reese skirts from a few years back that i still wear. so i am favorably disposed to this designer's style and quality. this is a slim fitting skirt  though i ordered it in a 6 and my two others are 8s. so i don't agree with previous review that this skirt runs large. it is nicely fitted and flattering. it does not ride up when sitting  which is almost amazing. i wish the pockets laid a bit flatter. also  on my skirt there is no sewn-in fabric or laundering instructions. none! th
1,The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy  flattering  and elegant  not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!
1,This sweater has beautiful colors & cute fur collar which can removed (nice).  i bought it impulsively.  when home i tried it on with a tee as sweater is warm. i had to take it off immediately as it is scratchy & itchy.  i could not wear this without a long sleeve tee underneath  but i would be too warm.  in the store  several sweaters had thread runs in them and from the weight of the sweater.  given the itchiness and potential to run  i am returning the sweater.
-1,The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery  details  and soft material are great  but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back.
0,Loved the fabric and details. the cut was a tad looser/bigger than i expected.  perfect dress for fall.
1,The colors of this top are my favorite part  i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that!
0,I thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu. the color is nice  the neck is cute  but the form unflattering. i'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back.
-1,I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing
0,"I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9"". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha"
0,Wanted to love this dress as it's perfect for transition. i'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer  and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off. my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it. i would implore the maker to try this style again as it's a good one  unfortunately the sizing was it's downfall.
1,Love these pants. got them in yellow- gold color. pair them with retailer anafa tiered top which also has some yellow tones to it. goes lovely. good quality. important for me - the color is soft  not overly bright yellow  fabric is soft as well. great fit.!
-1,I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible  unflattering  and laughable! please try again with this one  retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!
0,Online  i like the design  the leaves stand out. in-person  the leaves don't stand out as much  you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame  i think. it was just too light and thin for me.
1,This top fits exactly like the last photo  which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size  and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick  so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.
0,I bought the orange in xxs petite  and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.    i like a swing style  but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer  and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.
1,This is a beautiful shirt. i purchased the top in navy  the silver touch is pretty. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and m was perfect  tts. great for work or casual party.
0,I am sure these pants are right for someone  just not me. i am wider in the hips  and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight  which i wasn't expecting  and so while the pleats are interesting  with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise  but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short  these pants are probably great on some body types  just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
1,This dress looks better when wearing  i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect. length and width. in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length. the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length.  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily. i wish the slip is the same length as the dress. i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric. i hope it helps.
0,"I love the look of this dress & had high hopes  but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful  fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6""  155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide  so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small  but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang"
0,This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
0,It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me  but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though  because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress  but i would not rec
-1,"I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular  and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops  and  had i kept this  i would have gone with the m. ---------- this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1"" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi  the v neck is very de"
1,"Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available  i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall  140#  36dd  28"" waist  35"" hips  wide"
1,"I bought these in my usual size 28 and they were much too loose so i returned them. i definitely need a 27 (39 inch hips  33 low waist  31 waist). i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size 4-6 in pants. even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy 5' 9"" frame. they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model. if you are shorter  i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look. the material is not bright white wi"
