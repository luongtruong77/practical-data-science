-1,I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
-1,"I bought two  one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also  after one wear  the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on"
0,I really  really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however  it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress  i can't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.
-1,I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake  but i received the chiffon shell  but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes  but sadly  this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now  so i can't even reorder. bummer.
1,I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down.  is perfect!  one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own.  was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i'm short and curvy but it's very flattering.  can dress up or wear to the beach.  i love it!!
1,Beautiful colors. lightweight flannel  so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round. i ordered a s  my typical size  which turned out to be quite large on me. hopefully the xs will fit better.
-1,"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also  i like to have the first button open  but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding"
0,I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it  it looked exactly as it does in the picture online  however  the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms  which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt  but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.
0,I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice  very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch  105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking  but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women  but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.
-1,I didn't think top was very flattering and  while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd. this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom...just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful. sadly this one is going back to the store.
0,This is a beautiful top  however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.
1,I'm 5'8  130 and ordered a small. it fits very nice and it's flattering. my daughter doesn't like it as she thinks it looks like a t-shirt tucked into pants. i get that but it fits nicely and i like the pattern and tapered legs.
1,Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.
-1,This bunches up too much  and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it  it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top  i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.
0,"I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot  it had a flattering fit on me  extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1"" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct"
1,These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however  i got the petite  because i am 5'3  and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle  just like the photo  however  they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever  so i am gonna deal with the length!!
1,"This blouse is gorgeous. first of all  it's cotton! so  it is extremely comfortable. it isn't tighter in some areas more than others  but fits evenly throughout  which although a rarity  is wonderful. finally  a blouse that fits perfectly! i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered the regular xs and it hits right at my hips. i have a longer torso  however  so although i am not tall  the petite would have been too short for me. it is beautifully made and the red is a beautiful crimson on white. grab th"
-1,These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut  love the wide band in the front  true to size  quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller  but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back  since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
1,Love this sweatshirt! will look great with gray pilcro jeans i bought recently. xs fits perfectly and i am usually a s or xs.
-1,Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric  was bulky  and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..
0,I received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews. normally i would just exchange but i don't know if it's worth getting another broken one.
1,The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model  and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because  mainly  it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it  i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly  if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a
-1,I love eva franco   this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled   felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.
-1,I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee  but failed in quality and value. it was returned.
0,Tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom. top is perfect. will return the bottoms and try the large.
0,I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.
-1,I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger  it sort of looked like a tent on me  whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though  and it was folding down under the arms  making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center  as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we
1,Love this dress  very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it.
-1,This runs way big  i'm a size 8  purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape.
-1,I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also  it's pretty short  and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.
1,I purchased this in the red (really more of a brick color) and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too! i received a ton of compliments when i wore it! the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully. looks great over skinny jeans or leggings. i plan on wearing it year round!!
-1,I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.
0,After eyeing this product online for awhile  i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did  because while this dress is lovely  it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally  the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders  which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft  and the
-1,The neck is so big on this sweater  i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso  but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color  i liked the two-tone  but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on  but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.
-1,"I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being ""on"" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle ""ridge"" either as it was unflattering. it was returned."
0,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering"
0,I don't have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length  slits  tie  stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas  it isn't meant to be...
-1,I saw online  great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool  angora  mohair! 5'1  xsp  tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me.
1,I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!
-1,Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements  will not flatter you at all.
0,"This dress is very cute! i loved it. the quality is excellent. however  the fit is off. i'm 5""1  107lbs  32c. this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered. it was tight around the waist. this caused creasing and buldging in the back. the color is much more vibrant in person. i would have kept it  if it fit properly."
0,"Think price convinced me to put this in my bag ... the oops of on line shopping i guess. the strip and 'stitch' like snowflake is just not me. a little too ""cutesy' for me. if strip alone might have kept .. but this is just too much  not my style .. back it goes."
-1,I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8  and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d
-1,Love the idea of this top  but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.
1,This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too  so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.  it's so comfortable and it's made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it's a pretty straight cut.
0,"Beautiful blouse in theory  however  on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it"
1,Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. very comfortable  loose flowing  and has a slip underneath it. i'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size. with that  i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large  but thankfully the medium fits like a glove!
1,I love this shirt's color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s  so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it  however some women might be ok wearing it alone.
1,I am obsessed with this shirt! it's sooooo comfy and soft  like wearing a blanket! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes. comfy yet adorable.
-1,I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi
0,I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.
1,"I purchased this shell in black. the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality  like as shown. i am 5'4""  120# and typically purchase an xs. this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews  but i am overall happy with the top. the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust."
0,"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress  however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size  save for the length."
-1,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).
0,I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft  105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed  i really wanted this top to work.
0,I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern  but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.
1,Thanks to the vertical stripes  the adjustable neckline  the bow that cinches the waist  and the free flowing skirt  this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist  but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just
-1,"I bought this in the white  size m (140lbs.  5'8""  34b) because i wanted a baggy fit  which i got  so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white  which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size  this tee nips in at the waist.however  the quality of this tee is lacking  as it is the typical  cheap  marled  slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th"
0,I loved the look of this shirt  but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest. it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant.
1,I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it  but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy  but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.
0,"Im 5'1"" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100."
1,I bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall  so i bought it a size smaller than normal  but it fits  so i could say it runs a little big. very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture! i'm more top heavy  and it kind of camouflaged that  which is always great!
0,I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day  but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere  so i had to return it.
1,I loved this top  however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone  however their products do run a size small.
1,Fits true to size. good quality  style and length.
0,Note: if you have a large chest  the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt  just not great for the price.
0,Beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality. i hand washed (per the instructions) it after wearing it once  and the sleeves are already falling apart.
0,The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.
-1,This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it  and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide.     even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant  the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12  this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants  in sweater form. ridiculous!
1,Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size  unique in design  versatile  soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work  date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!
1,"I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4"" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it's warm  but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & ""where did you get that?""  definitely worth the purchase on sale."
