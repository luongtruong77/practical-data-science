0,This runs really large. i love it! sold out of xs p and xxs p... go figure :( size down if you are slim.
-1,Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute  someone had clearly bought this  worn it  and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!
0,Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed i'm returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful  the color lovely  the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror  it just was too much material  too big a bell shape. oh well  still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.
-1,The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top  arm holes and it was short. also i didn't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath.
1,Love these! so comfy and a great color! also love that it came in petite! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite!!!
1,I saw this sweater and just about died. i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves. lucky for me  retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted  and i snagged it right away. i just got it and am in love. it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be. the neckline in very flattering as well. it is soft and the color is gorgeous. if there is a negative  it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso  and doe
1,I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5' tall  110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone.
0,I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring  and it seemed perfect. plus  the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed  but i'd say surprised.     i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly  i would prefer it to be less stretchy  but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality
0,I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however  this was really tight. also  the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
-1,"I ordered this online  and when i opened the package  i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.    when i tried this on  the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also  the overall length is listed as 27"" long  but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10"")  hitting well above my hip bones.    if only this was much  m"
0,I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok  maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight  but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!
-1,The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
-1,This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise  it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.    this one is going back.
0,I've rarely met a maeve item i didnt like. initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but it's a structured cotton  making it a little more stiff than i'd like. i feel that making it suede would've been perfect for this dress. i am 5'2 140 lbs. usually a 4-6  i tried on the 6 and it was a great fit except for the chest area (34d) and the butt/hips area  making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region. i then tried on the 8 and it was way too big all a
1,I got this new dress for a work meeting and instantly received compliments. it has a very unique pattern that is perfect for the office or date night. it is a little long and falls below the knee  but otherwise the dress fits and feels great. the fabric has a nice weight  so it covers any imperfections you might want to hide.
0,"This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit  the fringed part was huge  kind of ""maternity."" i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about 4 inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously  it cannot be altered. so sad  must return."
-1,You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.
0,I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.
0,"I wear a typical 25 in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash isn't as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2"" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash  and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans."
1,"These are super soft and relaxed. i have them in navy and lavender. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs. and ordered them in a 28  which fits loosely  but comfortably."
-1,I have never written a review before  and i love retailer and shop here often. however  i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality  it looks thick and flows in the photo  it is very thin and it itches so bad  i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back  and do not recommend it at all.
-1,"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.    i did not even want to try it on  it's that bad. i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified.  for reference  i'm 5'10""  approximately the height/ size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it "
1,"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory  of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front  in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have"
1,Most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one! great cut  wish there were more color options.
0,I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.
1,I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat  and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it's feminine and delicate in appearance  yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it's awesome  just a perfect summer and probably fall dress.
-1,I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas  it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.
1,I tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did! i'm not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans. i'm a size 26 in pants but i bought size 25. i highly recommend!
0,I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller  it would work for you.
1,I'm normally an xl  but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy. the l fit great. it's tailored to the body  but not tight-fitting  just as shown on the model.    the detailing at the shoulders is heavy  compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee. so  it pulls the neckline forward a bit.     i bought the red and wow! it's a bright  fireengine red that's just stunning. it looks lighter in the photo. it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled.
-1,Material is too thin and quality is poor
-1,Didn't like at all. itchy fabric  looked good on model but on on busty girl.
-1,Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!
1,This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops  sandals  wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.
0,Very cute dress  just way too big. i ordered it online  wish i would have gone a size smaller.
0,"I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i'm bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i'm 5'5"" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips  the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it."
-1,After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately  the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it's just not a flattering cut or material. going back!
0,I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes  xs). after reading through the reviews  i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately  the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.
0,I ordered this in a small petite. with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing. i'm 5 ft tall about 118 pounds. i'm in between a 4 petite and a 6 petite depending on the brand  broad shouldered  slim hipped and very short waisted. i found this dress to fit a little large. it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck.  i'm sending this back sadly. quality is nice  though a bit thin for winter time.
1,I just love this dress! it is so pretty and feminine and comfortable. the colors and patterns are perfect for both spring and fall and i know that this is one piece that i will get a lot of use out of. originally  i thought the cut would be a bit boxy but it is not at all. in fact  the fabric is beautiful  soft  and flowy with a lovely bohemian aesthetic. it looks great with tights  tall boots and a big floppy wool hat. any one considering this dress should defiantly try it on  as it is highly u
-1,Loved the fit and colors  but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to.
-1,I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.
0,The front and back of this square sweater are the same  and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice  but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped  so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted  but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.
1,"Really like the quality  color  and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me  but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so  glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7""  128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans"
-1,The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.
0,I ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews. it is more like marroon. i am very disappointed. the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality. it is long and has the belt at the back  but the fit and quality overall are very plain. it looks a tad dowdy. i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings. but it is definitely not dressy. perhaps white may not look as bad. the plain design and marroon dull color don't help.
1,"Love the suit! i ordered two sizes  and this 6 ended up being too small. i'm 35x27x36 and 34d  and there wasn't enough support in the bust. read a lot of mixed reviews regarding sizing on the seafolly suits  so i'm glad i got two. suit is flattering and i love the coverage in the bottom. some boyshort suits are ""cheeky "" but these are not like that. only complaint is that while there is a pocket for the cups  they are sewn on top."
-1,The overall styling was great  and the dress is super-cute  if a little thick (it's made of denim  after all). i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it. the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.
0,I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple  chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality  the dress was 100% see-through  very thin  and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk  i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality)  but after trying it on i was really disappoin
0,I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately  even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall  it's a cute dress but just not for me.
-1,Love the shape and flow of this dress. but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back.  would not recommend
1,This is m frist pair of flares  and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed  but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly  but combined with the flare  the high waist is
1,I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!  true to size and nice length.  the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.  nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.  very nice!
0,Pretty tank  embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price  should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.
1,I was very hesitant about this. i read the previous reviews and thought oh no. the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasn't how i thought it would be. then i saw it up close  and i realized it was better than i thought. however  i didn't have time to try it on.    it wasn't until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have. i am so happy i purchased this. its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und
0,I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
-1,This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all. it had to go back.
1,Absolutely beautiful and well made. this pair of jeans is perfect  no flaws whatsoever. i usually wear size 27 but bought the 26 as it fits better. 27 is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans. i prefer it nice and fitted  so 26 works better. i'm lucky to find them still available in the store while it's not online. i didn't hesitate to buy at full price  which i rarely did. i'm so in love with my new purchase. very happy!
0,I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans  unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure  i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t
-1,I was expecting a tee shirt  but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.
-1,Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.
-1,"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it  but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider  more well-defined waist  with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top  but this was not the case. yes  the waist fit  but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top  turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly  this is going right back!"
-1,I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!
1,The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1  103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!
1,I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store  but  they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but  it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute  love it!
1,True to size so great fit from top to bottom. i am 5'5'' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low. it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area. it is very soft and comfortable. the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing.
-1,Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed)  but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
0,I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn't even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store  so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn't sown in  meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it's unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don't know if i would have purchased them. they are
1,I purchased this in my usual small (size 4-6) and it fits just the way it shows in the photo. it is very flowy which is th point. i wore it over a black romper and it looked great. i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank. keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up. seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy!  glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion. it is a classic piece for sure.
1,This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length  even though i got the regular and not the petite.
1,I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise. this sweater  like the one i purchased last season by the same designer  is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft (like cashmere soft). am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it!
