1,I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.
1,I am 5'1'' and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for me.  i don't usually go for peplum  but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft. when i tried it on  everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me. i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely. i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area.
1,I sat on this top for about 2 weeks waiting for more reviews to see if it was worth buying.  i finally took a chance on it and i'm glad that i did.  this top is really cute.  i love the asymetrical pattern.  it's long enough that it goes great with my black skinny jeans.  the v neckline is perfect...not too low.  i got this in my usual size large and it fits perfectly.   i wish that the sleeves were slightly longer  but that shouldn't be a problem for someone not as tall.  it's a quirky and ador
-1,This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
-1,"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering."
0,"This is a very lightweight  comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium  though the general fit was better. in the end  the looked medium too sloppy for my taste  and the small felt too small."
0,I really liked the top once i saw it  but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine  but it is a nice top.
-1,I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium  i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge.
0,"I'm 5'4""  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area."
1,Very pretty dress! wearing it for a family beach portrait. it may run a little big but not terribly. it is also not super long as pictured. i'm 5'6 and it's perfect with a flat.
0,Very cute shirt  well made  nice detail  but a little long for my taste but i did keep it
1,Lightweight and casual  i picked this jacket up on sale. i usually don't like sale items aggressively priced- there is usually a reason why it was a difficult sell to begin with  but this was a pleasant surprise- as in no surprise! picture depicts color and material well. great throw-on for running errands. clean lines  nice simple detail. only thing that is slightly annoying is that the off-center zipper makes the wider side flap over when not zipped  but this is true with almost any top cut th
-1,This top is so lovely  but runs soo big. i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home. i'm normally a size 14  and i was positively swimming in this top. hoping to exchange for a petite sm.
0,This dress is very cute on the model online  but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.
0,These leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants; the rise is perfect. the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger.
0,It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model  not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue  but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath  but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall  i'm very happy with this  though i'm also very very happy i got thi
-1,This dress looked adorable online  but unfortunately  it's not flattering at all  and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
1,You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt.  colors: can't tell from the picture  but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed  very fun and happy  yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering  the scallop part is interesting though  it is sown at one part of the skirt  in the middle  not sure why. i ordered the 0p  and that fit me like a glove. (26.5 in waist  35-36 in hips  115 lbs).    length on the petite was above the knee  like show
-1,I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
0,I wanted to love these  but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute  but unfortunately must go back for me.
0,I'm on the fence about this one. it is pretty
-1,I really wanted to love this dress. it is absolutely beautiful - the color  design and details. however  whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves  it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy. though i am slender  i have a chest. maybe that was the problem.
0,The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.
1,This dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fall/winter and strappy sandals in spring/summer. i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit. the navy is much darker than the picture.
-1,These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon)  7% polyester  and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump  and stretch out.   .  these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton  18% modal  2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton  at least in the stevies.  .  i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs  b
1,I saw this dress in my local retailer store  and am not sure why i did not try it on then  but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room  and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite  and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite
0,The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.
-1,Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person  runs very small. i returned it.
-1,Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all  it's not a happy orange  it a darker rust.  second  it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.
0,"I am 5'8"" and 130 lbs and bought a size s. it fits  but is not as roomy as it appears in the model and the sleeves are not as long. the collar fits strangely on me. the deal breaker was that the sweater is not soft  but is itchy and kind of coarse. i am returning this one."
0,Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft  the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy  which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.
-1,This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.  the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it  another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.
1,Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet  but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined  and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i
1,I love this top. of course i love most things that are denim  or look like denim. this is a fun twist on a denim shirt  the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching. i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional.
0,A nice comfy sweatshirt. i do wish it was just a tad longer; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i'm only 5'3! (i purchased the regular size not the petite)also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside.
-1,This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large  it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.
-1,It's a cute topper. it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms  and because of the a-line  through the bottom. but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i don't have a big chest. the fabric is very scratchy  and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped  and i suspect it had been worn.  going back. not tracy reese's best piece.
-1,After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.
0,I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
-1,I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!
1,I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota  so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is  the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets  which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me  and i ordere
1,This is a beautifu;l dress. unfortunately it runs extremely large. i wear sized 10-12 and ordered l. i was lost in all the material. but because i love this dress so much  i am taking a chance and ordered it in small.
0,The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.
1,This dress is really lovely in person. the fit was perfect and the length not too short. for reference  i'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit! (i'm an xl usually  and the fit was tts) the only thing i'm not crazy about is the slip  it's more of a flesh toned color. i'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these  retailer!
0,"I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side  but on my 5'7"" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!"
1,"Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online  i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5""6""  120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store."
1,Great jacket! warm as a coat yet thin enough to wear indoors. i dress up with a fitted dress  or dress down with jeans. very versatile and comfortable. i always get compliments on it.
-1,This looked like such a cute  casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said  it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on  i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
1,I love this dress! it is an easy throw on and go dress. the fabric is very soft and the cut is faltering. fit is true to size.
-1,I purchased this top in the black and tan color  loved the fit  style and fabric. however  it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front  which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.
0,Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however  the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.
1,I thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit. after trying it on in a store (must have been a return)  i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small. the straps were a little hard to manage. it is cute and i think cuter than on the model.
-1,"I was so excited for this dress to arrive  but when it did  it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also  the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful  but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6"" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back"
0,"This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said ""wow that's very elegant"". it is very soft. thin but warm. however  it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality"
-1,I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on
1,I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.  the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top.
1,I bought 2 of these in peach and maize. the fabric is yummy and soft as silk  the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great  however there is too much fabric! if only a bit less  the fabulous swing shape would work. that said  i'm keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors. i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house  if sale was on sale again.
0,I wish it were easier to get in this dress. i'm 5'4 with a 36d and i couldn't get it on. it's so pretty though.
0,I so wanted to love this dress  despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.
0,It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress  but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price  i expect something more exciting than what is  really  just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer  and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede
1,This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer  but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt  or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey  which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!
-1,I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.
-1,I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept  just didn't work for me.
-1,I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large  or something? ! i ordered an xs  my usual size  xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose  the upper arms are a bit snug  and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place  but when you look at the model  it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received  and another reviewer  the seam was puffy  making for a strange look. in theory  the shirt should have worked  but didn't. i loved the pattern  not the fit.
1,This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.
-1,I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces  so when i saw this sweatshirt online  i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky  however  when i received it in the mail  it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long  while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt  i would be keeping it  but sadly it&#39;s going back.
1,"These didn't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans. try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom! i didn't have anything to fill out the hips and seat. for reference  i ordered size 25  and they were loose in hip and seat  but fit my waist. my hips are 34.5"" and waist is 28"". they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear  but not jeggings thin."
1,Love this top! i have it in the green and i am tempted to go and buy it in the other colors! it is a simple  but cute top that is easy and comfortable to wear. a little dressier than a plain tee.
1,These leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control. i ordered the m and they fit perfectly  as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings. i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color.
0,The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big  it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics  not sure if it is because it's new.
0,"I have to send the skirt back. i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high  the ""underskirt"" bunches and the fabric snags easily. additionally  the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits  and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band. disappointed in the quality of this skirt  given the pretty steep price."
