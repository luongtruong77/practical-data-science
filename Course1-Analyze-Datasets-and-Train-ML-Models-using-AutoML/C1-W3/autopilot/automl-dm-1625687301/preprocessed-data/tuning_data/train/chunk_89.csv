0,This sweater is very pretty  i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn't flow the way i wanted it to  and i didn't love the v neck. just didn't pull me in completely!
0,"Like a previous reviewer  i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots  so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops  however with a 34d chest (5'5"" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t"
-1,Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
1,Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side  it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.
0,That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute  but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows  and the string is at least 3 feet too long.   not bad  i wear it with white gauze pants  looks nice. good with leggings too.
1,"I had my eye on this dress since it fist came out  but hesitated to order due to some of the lower reviews. when i got a chance to try it on - i loved it! i did go up a size. i am 5'5"" so i had it shortened to above the knee  i didn't mind losing the unfinished hem - had the hem match that of the pockets. i am a 34c but the bodice is stable and even if i pull at it  it stays put! so happy to find this  especially on sale! i plan to wear it at our company party which is help on a large charter bo"
-1,"In the words of my husband  ""looks like you're wearing a bag."" i'm althetic and short. maybe this works best on tall and very slim?"
1,I love this top! i ordered the print  and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans  and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews  and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.
0,I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable  on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be
0,This is really cute but does run large  if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy  imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable  ugh why! i loved the sleeves  very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton  vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.
1,This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan  but the quality and feel are better than usual.
0,I like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large  i am 5'7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall
1,The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though.
-1,"It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs  but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference  i am 5'7"" and 145lbs with 36"" 30"" 40"" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall  very good quality and beautiful"
-1,I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.
1,I saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best. i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust  so fit is not always easy. because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this. you may find  as i did  that it works dressed up or down. if i had bought a regular size  and were lots younger  it could have worked for a dress with tigh
1,This coat looks great  but the fabric is thin--only partly wool. the snaps also don&amp;amp;#39;t stay shut very well; i&amp;amp;#39;ll probably add a hook-and-eye closure for security. despite its flaws  it looks good enough that it&amp;amp;#39;s a keeper (when purchased on-sale).
-1,I love cotton fabric  so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color  and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once  and today when i put it on again  i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed.
0,I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away  otherwise i wasted $100.
-1,This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture  which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive  but in any case  this was just a really expensive polyester dress  which it says in the product description  but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt  thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product  it'll be retailer. but now i
-1,"I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8"" frame. wish it came in a tall size!"
0,"This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p"" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large."
-1,I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally  i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.
1,"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5""  120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it."
-1,One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless  huge  short and wide.
-1,Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...
0,The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however  the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area.
-1,These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.
0,I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.
-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.
1,I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size  i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.
-1,I love this shirt  love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden. but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(
-1,"These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5"" and the size 4 fit in the waist  but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on  they're also very poofy right below the waist."
1,This is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank. fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure. quality.
1,Such a festive sweater and i've received many compliments anytime i wear it. unique and fun to wear!
-1,Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking  i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.
0,The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how
-1,I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin  it might work for you too.
1,I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made  super soft  and works well with jeans  capris  skirts  and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though  this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a
0,This runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap. material feels like thinnest possible t-shirt material out there. surprised with retailer on this one. back home to retailer it goes!
0,Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me  and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom  it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.
0,Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut
1,I wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night. it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming! i got a petite 4  and it fit perfectly. for reference. i am 5'2 and 125 lbs. you ill not regret buying this dress!
0,This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.
-1,"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips  and the dress (size m for 140 lbs  5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric  like other reviewers - honestly  even if there were a snag or two  the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible  depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f"
0,I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully  the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also  there were a lot of thread h
-1,"The small  zipped and laid flat  measures 16"" across at the bottom of the armholes  11"" at the waist and 18"" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0  and not by just a little! too bad  because it really is very pretty."
0,Like the idea of this shirt so much. but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible. wishing the under layer really covered as no way i'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt. might just be my body type  so might work for someone else  but sending back.
1,This top is an amazing go to piece  and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto. i will say  that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear. therefore  it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time. good staple for a great price.
-1,This is so close to perfect  but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket  and totally in love  when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match  but nope  on every one. couldn't unsee  didn't buy. very disappointed.
1,This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.
0,This is a lovely dress  with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however  it runs small in the waist  if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.
0,I would have to wear a camisole underneath this  which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear  not something i'd have to layer.
1,Comfy cozy!
0,Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).  sadly  it's going back.
0,I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful  good quality  and a perfect summer maxi. however  it was way too big. i'm 5'6  118 lbs  i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress  so i choose to get it tailored.
0,I was so excited for this romper  but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price  and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(
1,As one would expect from boucle  this sweater is incredibly soft  warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful  goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling)  and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs  with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o
-1,Normally  hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out  the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra  you get to see the whole side of it. secondly  the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra  too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle
-1,I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still  the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them  i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.
-1,"Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts  or the cut of this was not right for me  but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small."
-1,I ordered this vest in xxs  since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then  the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big  not artfully drapey.
0,"I really liked the look of this top online  but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first  when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m  and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough  and as a teacher  i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly  my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.  on the other hand  the color palette is very pretty and the qual"
-1,First off  this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely  i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.
1,"Great  rather heavyweight  long cardi. i purchased the blue  which is a lovely shade of gray/blue  not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater  but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5""  136 lbs  34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model."
1,What a great shirt. however  none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture. the front of them are all a deep blue color  no tie-dyed effect or whatever you're seeing on the online pics. the shirt runs large. i am an 8/10 38c and the smaller size was plenty big. i can't imagine how the larger size would have looked! i think this top will go with many things  including as a cover up over dresses.
1,Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit. i am so glad that i bought it. it is beautiful and fits perfectly. classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color. the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it. i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future. i love it.
1,Love the pattern. the pants are really cute! perfect for pajamas or casual outfit to go to a fiends house in. they do have a funny seam above the knee but i still find them comfortable
1,"I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky. i am 5'6"" 123lbs. i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect. it is just long enough in the body for me. the shorts length is perfect  not too short or too long. i can't wait to wear this!"
0,Runs shorter than i expected.  i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size.
1,Love this top.!!! this is a very comfortable everyday top worn primarily with jeans. please make it in more colors. i think it should be less expensive.
