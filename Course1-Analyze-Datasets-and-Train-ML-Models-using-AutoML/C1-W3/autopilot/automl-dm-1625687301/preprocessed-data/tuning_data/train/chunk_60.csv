1,This dress runs a bit small in my opinion. for reference i'm a 36/38 c and usually a 10. the medium is tight at the bust. the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me. the sleeve and overall length are too short and i'm going to return it.
1,Gorgeous fabric. love the crochet back of top & cut out sides of bottoms. runs small. i'm 34a - small top fit. 26-36 - medium bottoms fit.
1,I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
-1,"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large  which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning  but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3""  weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly  it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money"
-1,I adore the feel and cut of these culottes  but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer. picks  piles  and serious wear and tear after just one day. i feel as if i wasted my money.
-1,I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality  especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great  but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.
1,I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
1,Not long ago  i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love  so when i saw these  i immediately tried them on. i love them too. they are pretty and comfortable  and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans! they are also very flattering. size wise  i find that i have to size down with hei hei  perhaps because they have a looser cut.
1,Runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small.
0,First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind  i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.  ----------  i typically wear a 27-29  depending on the brand and waist rise. these were an online return t
1,I'm 5'1  100lb and tried on pxs  ps and xs. the portions on the petite are perfect for petite sizes however if you are a d cup  keep in mind that you cannot wear anything thick underneath it if you go with the fitted size. the sleeves are pretty slim in the petite xs too. i'm keeping the pxs skirted trench because it looks like a dress from the fifties (fitted and flared) and looks so cute unbuttoned (like on the model). also  unlike some trenches there are minimum details (like epaulets  contra
1,Great arm coverage  soft material  flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple.
1,Super comfortable top. easily washable  2 options with the sleeves  and a nice drape to the fabric. truly a go-anywhere top.
1,Flattering! i love how it looks like a maxi dress.  fits me perfectly!
0,This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
-1,What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.
-1,The stone color was nice  but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.
-1,Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.
-1,"This dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me.    navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.    i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher"
-1,I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online  i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.
0,"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes  linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly  while wearing for the first time  i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there"
-1,I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review  but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits  and because the shirt is too short  it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well  but i'll still need to return this top.
-1,This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.
0,These are a great casual pants with a lot of style. my major disappointment comes from the inconsistent sizing within the size runs. i purchased a 29 in store which fit i then ordered another 29 online which did not fit  there is at least an inch difference please see photos. i then ordered a 30 online to see if that would be better and there's over 2 inches of difference within the same size run of the 30s.    who is making these pants? can't they get the pants to be the same size within the sa
0,This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright  colorful  quality jacquard  classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn't even zip it up all the way. returning :(
0,I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected  and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.
-1,I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.  my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front  back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.  the fabric is nice  p
-1,I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy  poor quality for the price.
-1,Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.
1,I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby  so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything  i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected  but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft  comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!
0,I ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top. also  the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring. it had to go back but others may love it (i have dark hair/olive skin). it also ran a small on top (i'm 38 d). there should be a pm available soon lol
0,If the sweater looked as it does in the picture  i would keep it. however  it was very boxy and short  a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.
-1,"Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste.   i'm 5'7"" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference.     retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it."
1,This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon  soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though
1,This top is super cute. the color is beautiful and the lace detail is very feminine. im a 36c and got the size small. it fits great.
1,The sleeves are small. should buy a larger size than usual. other than this is perfect.
1,I like this top. i received a ton of compliments when i wore it to work  but the material doesn't feel as high-quality as i had expected from the pictures online. it wasn't worth it to me to send it back  but i doubt i would have bought it if i had tried it on first.
1,Love everything about these pants. a little sheer  but super beautiful and comfortable.
-1,The design is gorgeous  the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however  it's extremely see thru.
0,The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought
0,Tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me. cute concept but poor execution
1,Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots.  very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways.  i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i'm sure the regular would've been fine.  looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram.
0,I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist  i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl
-1,Again  bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink  and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess  mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home  and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child  this one's going back!
-1,This dress fits awfully. it's not short  as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've  also  felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it  potentially  may look okay on someone who is very tall  skinny  and lanky  but i have my doubts about that too.
0,I really like this dress but after looking at the photo  it doesn't look like this  well at least on me. granted  i am 36dd so that might be part of the reason  but this dress is definitely trapeze style. i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant. because of this  a belt is a must. plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life.     another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru
0,Bells out to much i had to send it back
1,"I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs. i usually have a hard time finding pants or leggings that are short enough and fit just right. i ordered an xs  and these fit like a glove right away and i was so pleased! i ordered the brown and blue motif. i have only received the blue so far but love them. they hit just right at the ankle and aren't too loose at the bottom. it seems like they are made well but will wait until after the first wash. i'm someone that wears leggings all the time but love that these look like"
1,Love this shirt! it is great quality and fits true to size in a comfy not too fitted way that a button down should fit. i love that it is a classic white cotton shirt with a modern edge with the little bit of fringing on the bottom and sleeve cuffs. it's great to wear with jeans or leggings and i can even see dressing it up or down depending on the accessories worn. i have already gotten lots of compliments when wearing it....everyone wants to get it for themselves! i'd even get it in another co
1,Lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt. i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front. i am heavy chested though so that's how most tops fit me. i ordered the gray/black and it's really nice. i receive lots of compliments.
0,When i received this tank  i ordered the blue  i almost returned it because it seemed really thin  almost see through. however  once i tried it on it had a good fit  not see through  just lightweight and breezy. i especially like the twisted details on the straps. i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort  especially because it is on the thin side.
-1,Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made  not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty  this is not the dress for you.
0,Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.
-1,"I didn't mind the ""scratchiness"" others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front  but uncomfortable."
0,This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.
0,Loved this top  but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality
0,I was disappointed by this dress. i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up  a size 6 instead of my usual 4  and that was the correct size. fit like a glove. unfortunately  the style left much to be desired. this dress is very costume-y. i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair. not a good vibe. it is a beautiful dress  i'm not denying that  but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event. there's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric. i a
1,Loved pattern   quality and fine details on this dress but  it ran large. i ordered petite small and it was way too loose/baggy .i had to return it.  i went bsck to order a petite x/small  but it was no longer available in this size on- line. so disappointed!     fyi    i'm 5'   112-115lbs and small boned -always wear size petite small . but not fir this dress!     this dress is comfortable   well made  lined and pattern is extremely pretty with nice border ( which is hard to find for petites -a
1,I love this robe  it is my new favorite for lounging around the house
-1,I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
0,"I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve  you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck  so sweaters looked weird. short jackets didn't work either. i'm 5'4"" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"
-1,The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute.     now the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it's not... it's see through and unlined... it's scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine  the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail.     i wanted to like this  but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c
1,I love this crushed velvet dress in the rich blue color . i plan to wear it with short peep toe boots and also with ankle leggings and flats. so glad velvet is in this year!
0,This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.
0,Cute design for a casual top. however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium. i returned it
0,"I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles  this dress doesn't work if you're curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge  ordered an xxsp  the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said  ""that looks like something you'd wear if you were pregnan"
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath
1,"I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium  sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8""  athletic  150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!"
0,Cute fit but... split in the thigh after two weeks. and i'm not a big gal. poor quality.
0,I wanted to love this dress--a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date--but didn't for a couple of reasons.    first  it is way too short for me  especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay  to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also  the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th
-1,I bought a petite medium and the length was right  but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable  and didn't look completely terrible from the front  but from the side  it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing  but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.
-1,I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!
