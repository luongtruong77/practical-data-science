1,A perfect go-to top. looks great with jeans - dark   faded or bright white. top it with a cardigan or wear it bare - it offers a flattering fit with its high-quality  textured fabric. i normally wear a small or medium top. an extra-small fits me perfectly.
1,What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily  hugs all the right places and skims the others  feels like pajamas  and looks great for any occasion? i am about 120  5'-1'  32 dd  usually a 4 petite. i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos. i tried it on in the store in a regular small and x-small  and could have gone with either  but the petite had better proportions  especially where the v-neck hit (i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi
1,I bought this 'nightgown' to wear as a winter maternity dress. it really fit the bill!! the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well. there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress. it would be way too hot! it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter. i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer  the length was not awkward and kept it from being to
-1,Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.
-1,I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different  but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top  the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
-1,I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately  i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise  the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model  it looks like it skims the body  when in reality  it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt  but there was just too much fabric.    though the neck worked for me  i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also  it
1,Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.
1,Gorgeous top/tunic. runs true to size. i paired it with jeans  but i love the look of the white pants in the picture. beautiful and flows nicely.
1,This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it  the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.
0,I love this top and the beading is beautiful  but just like everyone else  it was way too large. i normally wear a lg  but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
1,Absolutely adore this jacket. i'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect. the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be. so perfect and beautiful  the embroidery is gorgeous  i feel so feminine in this coat
1,This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim  and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me  and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on  i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings  shorts  and sandals. such an easy  classic  simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.
1,"Got this dress in the blue and cream and it's gorgeous. i love that it's work and date night appropriate  but so comfy. i am 5'4"" but have very short legs  so it's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesn't drag on the ground. this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model  but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels. i got the small and it fits great. the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some"
1,I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual  2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown  so it is not constricting at all.
0,I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
-1,Cute enough  but i couldn't figure out what to do with the tie that didn't make it look like an extra set of sleeves  oddly placed.
-1,I love the way these jeans look and fit  but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them  but it doesn't seem to have helped.
-1,The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips  emphasizing them. the pants are sheer. the fabric was not comfortable against my skin. overall  the pants were a miss.
-1,"No  no  no...i don't know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging  or what  but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down. i'm 5'7""  about 145  32c  usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. this thing barely buttoned over my bust  and then flares out to a tent-like triangular shape at the bottom. i don't think it would come out by washing and ironing it; i'm afraid it was just cut poorly. i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes  unfortunately. i bought three different dresses in the"
-1,I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus  it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!
0,"40% sweaters...i couldn't pass it up. unfortunately  when i raise my arms  my tummy shows (i'm 5'6"")  so i had to return it."
-1,I ordered this dress in a size 8  my normal size at retailer. it is a lovely dress and so feminine  but it is incorrectly sized. i couldn't begin to button it. i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything. buyer beware. unless you are itsy bitsy  you need to size up. i will say that as pretty as the photos are  the dress is even more lovely in person.
-1,I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.
0,I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer  but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is.
0,Lots of pairs of the pilcro serif-- and for some reason  after 5mo or less of normal wear  these have bit the dust.   i don't dry my denim and do wash on gentle cycles... this pair just doesn't seem to be too happy. began pilling after two washes  just seems to be a different blend of fabric than the others?     super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp.
0,"I wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer  but it just didn't work for me. it made me feel a bit frumpy  honestly. i purchased the neutral color. maybe the ""red"" would have been less... grandmotherly. something about the elastic waist just didn't work for me either. i tried this with boots  booties  heels  clogs  flats  sandals and i just couldn't make this dress work. sadly sending this one back. i'm 5'7""  140 lbs and tried the medium."
-1,I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern  when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale  which it definitely will be  but even then am not positive i would keep it.
-1,I really wanted to like this top  just got it in mail today  but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it  but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color  very soft too  unusual for rayon of this type  feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red  size
-1,This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric  it's very boxy  & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it's still just wide. i'm returning :(
1,This is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath  and will be fun in the summer too. i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out  and it was still really cute. great cut and design. as others have mentioned  the quality could be slightly better  but it's a good deal if you get it on sale.
0,Soft cotton front  slightly more coarse back. shoulders run slimmer than bottom which flares out. bought on sale as a cute pajama top which will definitely work well. could also imagine with skinny jeans. normally wear a s  ordered an xs.
0,I really wanted to like this  but like other reviews say  the knit fabric pills easily and i don't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton. a good deal on sale  but i don't think it will hold up very long. i got the teal/white  as black/white and coral/navy were sold out.
-1,I found this dress to be very short waisted  much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.
1,I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic that will be in my closet for a long time.
1,True to size  and adorable. very lightweight  will be great for the long  hot summer ahead!
1,I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple  yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!
1,"I think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring. i'm 5' 7.5"" and it's a great tunic length on me. it's really pretty and i love it. snap it up on sale!"
1,Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.
-1,I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.
0,This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it wouldn't stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest!
0,"I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of ""genie"" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle  but the worst is the fabric. its ""old lady"" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim  and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping."
1,I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but  once i washed it (in cold in my machine  reshaped and air-dried)  it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.
0,I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately  i couldn't make the fit work. for reference  i am 5'3  110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers  i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms  and i don't have particularly large arms  so i ordered the sp  hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately  the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l
-1,It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.
-1,"This sweater was huge  it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy  it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s  and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick  i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame......."
0,Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it  was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!
0,"This top is so pretty in the photos  but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size  but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made  so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference  i'm 5'5"" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly  but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect  but i'll sa"
1,I love these pants! first  they are super flattering. for a new mom  the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second  they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats  boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large  because they aren't too loose.
1,I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but  i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately  it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal
1,Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.
0,I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.
-1,"Couldn't make it work  even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan  like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all  just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust)  then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy  curvy waist  but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a  tried xs)"
0,The print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch. unfortunately  it runs quite small in the bust  so i had to return it. for someone that is small busted  it will be quite cute. everywhere else it is true to size.
-1,I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer  within a few weeks  having worn them no more than a couple of times  the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing  as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.
0,The sweater is cute  but scratchy.
0,May look better on someone tall. thin  and straight.
0,I love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous  but the pictures make it look much longer than it is. i would've loved it if i were petite but i personally don't think it's meant for taller people. such a shame.
1,The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it's very flattering and slimming.
1,I really love this shirt for its versatility. it looks casual with jeans and dressy with a skirt  or even jeans and heels. the shirt itself is super soft. it's boxier than it looks in the picture  but not to the point of crop-top. the shirt still hits at my hips.
-1,My favorite colors are purple and green  so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves  i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it  just huge  flowy  green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it  but now that i'm trying it on in the house  i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t
0,I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house  they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.
-1,Totally see through.
1,Don't detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated. i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it (cute) but reattaching was the biggest pain! i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit. so other than that--buy this sweater if you get a chance. it's stylish  flattering  soft  versatile  etc  etc...
0,There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.
0,"This top came down to my hip bones  but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for ""regular"" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26"" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice  and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing  i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model  but n"
0,"I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6"" 145 lbs  athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great  just like glove  it does not make me look fat. the quality is great sweater is warm  cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral  it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw"
-1,Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.
1,I love this dress for it's unique design with the crochet features. it is super comfortable  great for being layered without see through. i ordered a small though and it is still too large for me. i have been trying to decide on returning it since i love it so much. i'd recommend sizing down for this dress. i'm 5'6''  135lbs  and still needed an xs which seems a bit off. i guess i'm used to retailer running a bit big  but i miss judge this one and hate to deal with the mailing and worrying
0,I actually love this dress.  the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing.  the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look.  my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering.  i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more.  i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does  so i sized up.  all this did was make me look wider  especially at the shoulders.  the drawstring at the elastic makes
0,I know this is supposed to be a loose  flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however  this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer  especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
-1,I am reasonably petite  but i like sweaters very oversized and large  so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large  the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size  the sweater ended up looking very awkward  with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do
-1,"This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be ""weird""."
