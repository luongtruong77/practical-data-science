0,I love the look of this dress. the fitting could use some work--the top layer could be slightly more fitted--but overall it looks adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops.     my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material. one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size. for the price of this dress  i don't expect disposable clothing. if i had known it would shrink  i would've hand wa
-1,This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear  but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me!
1,"This jumpsuit is cuter than it looks online. my store displayed it with a brown belt  which dresses it up. it is perfect for our hot summers with brown or silver sandals. i will wear it with a short sleeve white cotton tee. i'm 5' 7"" and bought the extra small. pricey but worth it  so stylish. so retailer!"
-1,Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
1,Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it's a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus
-1,I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot  but the hole will be a little trickier  as the material is kind of filmy.
0,It's a very pretty top. a little tight in front at the bust. i'm giving it 3 stars because the fabric is very flimsy and looks cheap.
0,"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner."
0,Let me start off by saying i never write reviews  but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi
0,"Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. a small should be fine  but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami)  but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs  but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer."
1,I love this sweater! i was nervous after reading the reviews  but ordered it anyway and i'm so glad i did. i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part-- flirty and feminine  unique but also subtle. i don't think the material is scratchy. it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts  but i wouldn't call it scratchy. it was perfectly comfortable to me. i will say that it's a little short though. i vary between a m and l  depending on the shirt (5'9  long torso  36c
1,My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas1 i am thrilled  & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!
1,I love this shirt. it's different than other summer tops. it's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size  and runs true to size. on a windy day the front will come open  but only to your stomach.
-1,The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
1,"This one is perfect for the taller ladies (or those looking for a longer fit). i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently  and this one finally works for me (at 5'7"" with a long torso). awesome quality  not overly delicate  and beautiful detail."
1,I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.
-1,"What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2""  but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me  so i'll be returning it."
1,I like that you can dress this shirt up or down. go out  or lounge in it! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it.
-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return
0,This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.
1,I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on  on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable.
-1,This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.
-1,"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely  the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out  so i visited another retailer  and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me  it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12. the colors  the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me."
1,It is beautiful  but not practical for me - the student who carries a backpack ! i didn't notice it doesn't have sleeves  it is regular poncho  soft and stylish . recommended for poncho lovers !
-1,Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!
0,"First  let me start out by giving a reference. i am 5'1""  138lbs  34dd  30  38. i usually take a size 8 in maeve  esp if there is no give. i bought a regular size 6.     first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips.     the bad: surprisingly  the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f"
1,Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.
1,I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts. i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did. the fit is lovely and flattering. i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color.
-1,I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe  but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).
0,I bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color. however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible. i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective... it didn't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate  i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed. after that alteration (on my own dime) i was very happy with the dress and
-1,"This is a rare review for me  i usually love my retailer purchases  even at times when other reviewers aren't fans  but this top is terrible. 5'4"" 103  32 b for reference  small frame  athletic  bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer  but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area  however  a different story. because it's boxy  and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers  the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape  it did not fit snuggly"
1,This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me  but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size  with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls  but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais
0,I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.
-1,Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
1,Wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn. the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad. bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater!
1,Very cute top and so comfortable! it runs big i'm between a medium and large. i ordered the large and it's definitely a little big but wearable. i probably should've swapped it for a medium but it's still really cute!
1,"Really like this tunic a lot. it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together. i'm always a fan of pockets too! i ordered the xs -- i'm 5'4"" about 118#. it fits loose but not in a bad way. the fabric allows it to fall well over the body. if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees. glad to have snagged this right away! more tunics like this please!"
-1,"I ordered the black & white  00 petite. i'm 5' 2""  96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23"" (on the back  from neckline) which is great for me; however  the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25""  so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00  regular length  but then the sleeves will b"
0,Love the color  but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms  the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.
1,I love this jacket. it's easy to dress up or be casual. the black is more like a very dark grey.
-1,I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived  i was excited to try it on  but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large  not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end  i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad  as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.
0,I tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different  awkward hem line. they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked. finally found one that wasn't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs. i am a curvy  athletic build  with broad shoulders and small waist  for your reference.
1,I was attracted to this sweater because of it's unique style. i really love it. it looks just like the picture. it is of good quality  as is the leather belt. it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it's different. i highly recommend this sweater.
0,"I bought the s; came with a tag saying ""sz 8"". it is in fact more like a size 2  if not 0.     the bust is probably a 34 a or b  or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well  but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it  so i will return it.     the fabric  design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality."
1,This is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small. i usually take a small but i took a medium in this. for reference i am 130 lbs  chest 36c. i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate. got the 20% off today and couldn't be happier with this purchase.
1,The dress has some cute features. the little belt motif hits too high on me and the drop waist is a little awkward. but it is comfortable and looks best with some kind of shirt worn underneath
-1,When i received this dress in the mail  i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style  although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress  his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.
-1,The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on  it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall  i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.
0,This is a cute  flattering dress  however the drop-waist  the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn't convey an elegant  mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it's great because it's not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.    my big problem is the lack of transparency regarding the actual slee
1,"I got the purple motif and loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. i am 5'6"" and 107lbs.  32d. the small was too big and there were no xs or xxs."
0,This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined  the belt adds a needed accent  and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit  though  is another issue. i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses  and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a 2 in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip  thigh
-1,Sadly  this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch  my purse  my necklace. i had to go home  change  and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress.
0,"What i liked:  1. midweight fabric. it's not lined and when i read polyester in the description  i was worried that it might be thin  but this is a stretchy midweight fabric.  2. pretty pretty print    what i did not like:  1. i don't know what dress the model is wearing  but this was an empire waist dress on me. i'm 5'7"". because it was empire waist  the long hem makes this look like a maternity dress on me.  2. the sleeves are cut oddly. they look too wide for the dress  even on this model.  3"
1,This tank is very loose fitting  which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps  i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling  which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.
1,A really beautiful  well made dress. runs extremely big though! i'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i'm positively swimming in it. an oversized look works for this particular dress  but i think it's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style.
0,This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes  it does run large  but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm  it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside  but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?
0,Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way  came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material  recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size  my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.
-1,So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
1,Adorable jacket. i ordered the medium (5'4  135 lbs). sleeves are long and have to roll them up. ordering the petite medium to see if it fits better. pink color is great.
0,"I am 5' 4 1/2""  125 lbs.  and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also  i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color  but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online."
0,I never write reviews
-1,The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large  the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish  the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining  i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned
-1,I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.
-1,The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
0,Wow  this runs small! i'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs?!?
0,"This pant is beautiful and fits great except for the waist. it is too big. i carry all my extra weight in my waist too. 5' 6 1/2""  150lbs  straight and up down figure. the waist gapped in the back almost 2 inches. otherwise this is a great pant  if you have a well developed bootie  maybe they would fit. ordered a 10 by the way. if they make it to sale  will purchase again and take to tailor. they are a well constructed lovely pant."
0,I ordered the xxs p  but the actual cardigan is a xs p.  i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out. well  it fits ok anyway. (115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist)  beautiful sweater but oh so itchy. i think wool should be listed first (like ingredients) it is really itchy. why i so torn. i want to keep it because it is nice  but it is itchy. i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath  i don't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless. colors and pattern are warm neutral  not red.
-1,Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.
0,This top is very pretty on the hanger. however  i have a curvy bust  and it was incredibly unflattering on my body. boxy  too high of a neckline  unattractive. the plus sides to it are that crochet detailing is lovely  and the color is nice as well. maybe if you have a 1920's frame it would work.
-1,I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished.   the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.
-1,The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.
