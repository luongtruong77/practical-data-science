1,This is a beautiful blouse. very pretty and looks well made. unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm looking for a more classic cut. it has an a line/tent shape. when i put it on and put my arms above my head  the bottom of the blouse was up to my bra! i would order from this brand again.
0,I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest  it was shorter than i usually like my tops  so i will be returning it.
-1,Ugh  i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don't have a straight on photo of the shirt  its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it's definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn't returned i
1,These cords are a great  skinny fit.  they seem true to size for me and look great on.  only issue i would have is the color says navy  but they are more of a deep purple-ish color.  i had to recheck my order because they definitely aren't navy....but i'm keeping them because the fit is awesome.
-1,I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty  but it was not my size  so i didn't try it on. when it arrived  it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i'll be taking it back very soon. i do plan
0,Although i am small (size xs on top  27 waist) this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your body....i would not recommend it.
-1,I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two  if not three  sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body  other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough  especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w
0,It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
0,I thought this top had shimmery dots  that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived  it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.
1,This top is very comfortable and really cute on. the material is super soft. i bought the white and am very happy with it  but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it. i would definitely recommend!
1,I really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila' - i love the shorts too! colors are great and you don't have to cuff them if they seem too short - they're versatile and who doesn't love options?????
0,"For reference  i'm 113 lbs  with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft  comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line  it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also  it is a ""mixed-media/material"" type. for example  it's linen with soft leather accents  which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar  on the wrist area "
-1,I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty  beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it
1,"I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress  as it's taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it's drapey but not voluminous  with no pulling at the hips. the ""folded"" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders  but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest  and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4"" & the size s hits me just above the knee."
-1,"Sadly  going back. ordered m  light color option  very difficult to pull over my head  not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle)  but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l  but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric  it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast""  which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle"
-1,I don't normally review my purchases  but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made  i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made  good quality dress for the high price tag.
-1,When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out  saggy and faded.  so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
1,It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim  but not tight fit.
-1,I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less)  i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos  the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered  i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs
0,This has a sparkle that you can't see in the pictures. i returned it. the design is cute but not worth the price.
-1,This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16  this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time  unfortunately  neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
0,This is a cute dress  but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup  anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.
1,The fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering  it doesn't stick out too far over the butt. the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall. looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights. i'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one.
-1,This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.
1,The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic  thin tank  but it's a good every day  wear all the time staple.
1,I tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite  and they are both too long (which means i will have to hem). i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color. they fit like a glove otherwise (i do have muscular thighs). the 0p is good for me (115 lbs). can't go wrong for a nice pant  i can see wearing these out or for work...
1,I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer  but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didn't matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!
-1,I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.
0,I wanted to love this skirt it was good quality  but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it
1,I haven't worn a pair of levis in ages  and had forgotten how great they are. i have recently lost weight and i have to say they are very flattering. i wasn't sure at first how i would ilike the frayed hems  but they are growing on me.
1,I bought this cardigan in grey. it's sturdy  soft  great layering sweater over a top or even under a heavier sweater. the tail in back is long and unique. the shape is flattering. and for a lighter cardigan  it's more substantial than others out there. the sleeves are long enough for my long arms  which i love.
0,I don't think they are an easy fit cut  they are more like skinny jeans. as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them. the quality of the material is good  the color is nice.
1,Beautiful angel of the north sweater! tts  lovely color and a staple classic.
0,Wanted to love these pants  they are way  way  too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.
1,I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!
-1,This sweater has the weirdest stitching  although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)
-1,"Within 2 washings the color faded to a not so black black  like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year's use. after 5 or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off. the pants fit well  albeit a bit short (i'm 5'9"") and they run small. i sized up to a 6  when i usually am between a 2 or 4. i let the hem out  sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them  and now they are good to go  but for nearly $90 i don't expect to have to do this much work. these are not my first"
0,The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size  as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price  but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute  casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the
1,Been wanting a pair of high waisted sailor pants for a while and these are perfect! love the fabric . will be able to wear these in the spring  summer  and into fall. bought the 2 petite and the fit is perfect. nice drape and figure flattering. even the petite runs long and will have to wear with a high heel rather than flats. bought the black and thinking about purchasing the white pair as well. very very nice and i am very happy with this purchase.
0,"The material and construction of the pants are great  but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4"" and the regular came to just above my ankles  and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine  or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants  but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4""  125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips."
-1,I really wanted to like this top. in person though  the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.
1,These are very cute but very  very stiff. have washed 3x and still not relaxing. not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear. my waist is smaller and generally  have gap in waist to get fit right in hips. super cute with sandals  mules  duck boots.
1,Very cute shorts. sadly  after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned. disappointing quality.
0,I think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured. i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean  but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed. the color is slightly brighter than the picture  which is fine  though i was digging the slightly greyed look.    anyway  these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else. i have a fairly athletic build  so it's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs 
0,These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!
1,What i like about this is the yellow color peeking through the white  it makes the tank look sunny/happy.  soft tank  fabric is really comfortable  fit is loose and casual  i was undecided but thought i have so many nice pieces  i don't need this one . xsp was a good fit. i am 115 lbs  30 dd.
1,I bought this top in 2 colors. it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear  so i bought it in the 3rd color. it's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel  weekends  and work. the feel of the fabric is gorgeous  but it pills after wear. so when the top went on sale  i bought an extra set of all 3 colors. now i have a set for play and a set for work. i love this shirt.
0,I got this 25% off before christmas. i immediately started wearing it  thinking it would be a staple. i like the swing shape; the shape feels just right - not too baggy. but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals  collects lint like crazy  and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times. also  there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area (as you can see in retailer's picture). it looks out of place in person. i'm left loving the s
0,I don't mind loose-fitting clothing  but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling  tying  pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes  and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body  i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings  then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed  especially since the design on the fabr
-1,This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also  the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
-1,After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful  but only for one use.
-1,An absolutely gorgeous  but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.
0,This cardigan is very soft and feminine. it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere. i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room. if you don't mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater.
1,Tried these on several times in store and never bought them  but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable  perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!
0,I was really excited for this sweater  its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.
1,I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top  no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.
0,I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea  but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model  so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me  because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful  the pink is more a blush and washed me out  the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t
-1,I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it  i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however  the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves.
1,This really is a pretty top. i do wish it was a little thicker but it's not as see-through as other tees i've seen.
0,I love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on  but within a day of wear  i noticed significant pilling  which made it appear much older / worn.
-1,I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.
0,I'm very pale  and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin  though.
0,This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
-1,I wore this for a few hours  and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no  i didn't buy too small  and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.
-1,I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large  i usually wear a large  and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad  it looked adorable and i was so excited to try
0,Lovely fabric  color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can't even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don't buy sewing or ironing).    disappointed.
0,Beautiful thick sturdy denim. probably the best denim i own in terms of the material. the cut can be awkward as it can be tight across the thighs and hips and kinda makes my butt flat. however i love the wash and quality of the material and at a sales price  totally worth it.
1,"I am 5'3""  130b  small waist  wide hips. dress fits perfectly  a little longer than i had expected (hits about mid-calf on me). great quality corduroy  nice medium green color. very unique  sort of vintage feel piece."
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.
-1,"This jumpsuit looked so great on the model  and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4"" and in great shape  and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!"
1,This tee is so cute and well constructed. it's not a fabric that's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra!
