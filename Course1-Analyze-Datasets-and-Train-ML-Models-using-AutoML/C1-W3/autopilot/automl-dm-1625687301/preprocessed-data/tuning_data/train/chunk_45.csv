0,Nice dress  you can wash it  i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect    brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material.   material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving.   i will be returning it for that reason  too heavy for summer .
1,Love the feminine take on flannel and how it fits like a tailored shirt. i am a bit long waisted and the side slit reveals a little too much when i lift my arms. if the shirt was just a little longer it would be perfect.
0,I tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online. the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it. i'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package. trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing.   it really is very cute on.
-1,I thought the sweater itself was beautiful  but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.
1,I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers  but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws  the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck  not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining  this is a spring and early fall dress
0,I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t
0,This blouse is very pretty  but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it  or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit.
-1,I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy  don't buy. however  if you want more of a fitted blouse feel  then go for it.
-1,I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.
0,I wanted to own this so badly! it ran really short  even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders. i could barely get the dress off!
0,This top light and airy  which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however  this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.
-1,I saw this top online and ordered immediately!  i loved the color  lace  and unique details.  sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!  the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly  and is very rough against your skin.  the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way. .....  that although i am so in love with this color  i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.  it could have been fantastic  if the lace was softer  and some a
1,These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!
1,I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size  medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight  casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.
0,Love the print and comfort of this tank  however  it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank  it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.
1,This is ruching done right! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well.  it is fitted  but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places. it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything. so unless this particular color is your nemesis  this dress is a winner!
1,The fun coloring of this tee gives what would otherwise be a basic tee it's flare. it is a very soft shirt and will be cute with anything. the length is good too - you can tuck in or leave out. i believe it is tts. it might be a little sheer in some lights  but i think you could pull it off with a nude-colored bra. it's not sheer enough to me to warrant an undershirt.
-1,Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.    the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess.     looking beyond that  i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders  but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also  front b
-1,This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.
0,"I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10""  and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model  and the cut was just too wide under the armpits."
0,Looks great from the front  but from the side it looks like a maternity top.
-1,I usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts  but this way too high  and the fit was really unflattering. i can see it being chic on a tall  slender person  but it's definitely not right for my short  curvy body. returning it today.
1,"Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l  5'8"" 175lbs  am busty. very nice fabric  prone to wrinkles."
0,"I really  really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately  i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6""  but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)"
0,This is a very comfortable shirt    great basic to have in the wardrobe    it runs a little high on the sides
1,The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.  i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit  so if you prefer something more form fitting  you might opt for a smaller size.
0,I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!
-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however  after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust  combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma
0,I was so excited to get this top..but it's boxy and a little itchy from the design. i just didn't think it was worth the hefty price. i'm normally a small in retailer clothing
1,I absolutely love this dress... tried it on one size down from my usual...it fit but my size would be perfect and 8 and 10 are out of stock. it's stunning and i love it... i badly have to have it... please bring it back retailer:)
0,I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress  but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin  taller person.
-1,I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag  no fit   no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale  it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.
1,"I love a jumpsuit for its ease of dressing. this is the 3rd i've purchased from retailer. material is thin and gauzy as described. with a sweater or jacket it will be plenty warm for so cal winters and great the rest of the year. if you are all tall  the waist might fall a bit short. i am 5'6"" and the waist just barely hits my waistline. doubt i would have purchased this item full price  but on sale it's a great deal."
1,Love this cardigan. the quality is beautiful and and comfortable. i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch.
-1,A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric  bunchy skirt  teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.
-1,Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy  shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
1,While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head  i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!
0,This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however  if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c)  the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.
0,I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly  it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv
0,The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.
1,"I am normally a pretty big fan of the moth brand  but i took a chance on this dress/tunic and i am so glad i did! i love love love this piece. it's soft  light weight material make t perfectly versatile so spring  winter and fall. it's so easy to throw on with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans and dress up or down with a scarf or necklace. i've already worn it several times and wearing it right now actually! it fits very true to size  i am 36d  31"" waist and 5' 2"" so i ordered a large and it fi"
-1,When i saw this top online  i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead  the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...
-1,I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall
-1,I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair  the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong  but those were even worse. they looked obscene.
-1,"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model  where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was  i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7"""
-1,Beautiful fabric! unfortunately  i had to return it. after just one wear  it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!
0,"I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on  the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami  which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described)  but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel"
-1,I loved the look of this sweater on-line  but it just didn't work for me. the fit wasn't good enough. the style okay. the color fine. the feel  scratchy. overall  it did not work for my body.
1,This cardigan is super soft and comfy with nice big pockets and an easy feel. i am glad i read the other reviews before i bought it  though. i usually wear an xl (and they are often too small)  but i ordered a large and even that one is a bit on the generous size. but i really like it a lot!
-1,Even following the care label exactly  it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.
1,I ordered this shirt last week  and i wore it as soon as it arrived. it is a beautiful shirt with an original design. it is rather casual  but you can dress it up with the right accessories. the print appears to be navy (it was advertised as black)  and it looks great with jeans. i would certainly recommend this item.
-1,"I'm on the shorter (5''3"") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly  i returned it."
1,"I have been wanting this skirt since it came out  and was overjoyed when it went on sale. i got my typical 00 size (24-26 waist  xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses)  but when i tried it on i was a bit confused. the waist is a little roomy so there's no way i could wear a 0  but the skirt hugs my butt. and i'm talking in that weird ""hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way"". now i don't consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department  but this skirt sure says the opposite! i can'"
-1,For the price of this dress  i was expecting something decent. the style is cute  but nothing more. however  the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material  that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.  the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.  no need to say - it's going back asap.  you should not sel
0,When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough  but it has a weird under wire  it makes my chest look strange  like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.
1,I was trying on the cream knit turtleneck midi dress in the store  and wanted the shearling vest shown with it to work for me. the dress is sleeveless  very good looking on  but the vest on me was too much  looked like i was being swallowed by a huge shearling taco. i wanted and needed something to stay warm in without the bulk of a full coat. the stylist brought me this jacket  and it was just the thing for me. its classic and modern  warm without bulk  and the two tone complimented the dress a
0,Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight  i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely  so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.
1,The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body.
-1,Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.
-1,First of all  this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said  it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size  and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy  durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c
-1,I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft  with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide  25% royal baby alpaca  20% fine merino) threw it  but had i felt this in store  i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
0,Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust
1,I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.
1,This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace  embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit  because i would like to button the sh
1,Very cute on  fits well. versatile top  i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall.
1,"This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4"" 120lbs  about a size 4 in dresses  32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height  it's just a few inches above my ankle  so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length  and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal  there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra  and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric"
0,I like the quality of material of this top but it's too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
0,I really wanted this to work. alas  it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up  and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up  but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.
0,"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured  only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late  everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured  a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me"
1,I love this dress  it's very comfortable  slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light  i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall  i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.
1,I love this dress! my bra straps do not show in the back. you can slightly see them in the front but wearing black or nude gets you around this problem. i love the slim design-it is very flattering. i tried this is my normal size 4 but also the 4 petite. the petite did not work for me since there is a larger fabric cutout for the butt area-this was too high and above my natural waste. because of this  i opted for the slightly longer option where the extra fabric was surrounding my bum. this does
