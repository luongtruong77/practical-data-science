-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially  then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute  but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.
-1,I loved the design and material of the test  but unfortunately it just did not fit me right. it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for.   also the pattern did not look good on me.   unfortunately i had to return.
1,"This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee  not below since i am 5' 3"" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!"
-1,"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3""  but it fe"
1,I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....
0,This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.  there's a nice drape to the fabric  but it's cut pretty short and wide  which isn't flattering imo  unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.  i would have given it a higher star rat
-1,It is a beautiful top but runs huge!!! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it!!
0,"Just didnt like the fit. it ""puffed out"" in front  so that wasnt very flattering. i have an hourglass shape  and this was not a good fit for me."
1,I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos  and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting  but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy  but the knit gives it more texture & interest. this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered  but form-fitting and flattering.
-1,"I was so excited to try these  it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee."
0,Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock under my arm  which could be seen  i guess  if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next  who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top  i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b
1,These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down  which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn't affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm
1,"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing  and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers  i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos  but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted  and although it is i"
0,The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.
0,"I'm 5'6"" and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i don't want to deal with having to wear a cami."
1,This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans  culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators  summer booties  and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not
0,I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white  which you can plainly see in the picture  but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.
-1,Lovey top in the photos. however  its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3  118lbs  36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some.
1,This is the softest shirt  super comfy  very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up  or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft  i love it!
-1,Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo  this sweater is a faded  boring  teal-green. what a huge disappointment.
0,Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular.
1,I hated to send this dress back  but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress. sent it back. it is meant for taller and more slender women.
-1,Like other reviewers have said  this is very sheer  look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other  tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose  billowy  and perhaps
-1,I've been shopping at retailer since 2007  and floreat used to be my favorite designer  but for the past year or more  floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model.   1. it is long on her  not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this  i might try on a size m and give it another chance.  2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this  as mentioned above.  3. in the picture  t
-1,Just received these and they fit perfectly  but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise  but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning
0,I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small  rather  i believe  they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging  but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless  i won't be wearing these!
1,I have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them. i had to get these when i saw them in the store. i'm a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring. i also love the dark wash. i was surprised when i tried on my usual size 27 that they were too tight. i ended up going with a size 28. for reference i am 5'4  122 lbs.
-1,I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick  stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!
1,This has quickly become my go-to cardigan! it's light which will make it great for the spring and summer nights. i got it in the rose... and loved it so much i bought the olive too. bought a small- fits perfectly! arm length is great too.
0,I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute  but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack  big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad  i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.
-1,This dress is huge. also  i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse  more like a poplin  and thin. i thought it looked cheap.
-1,"I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos  and have purchased many pairs. however  the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved  although they have the exact same name. they are now ""boy cut""  and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say ""boy cut"". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri"
1,Great top! a little large  but i shrank it a little in the wash  and it fits a little better now. i love the structure and pattern of this top  as well as the lovely coral/orange color. it can be dressed up or dressed down! love it!
-1,Like some other reviewers  i  too  have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself  i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust  and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps  i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool  and i was rea
0,I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater  more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute  warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.
-1,I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer  my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender  but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...    firstly  the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr
-1,I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut  but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.
1,This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated  vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt  jeans  skinny cargos. endless possibilities.
0,Two strikes against this top  and its going back. first  the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact  since i have tanks i could have worn  but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price  i wouldn't have expected b
-1,When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress  the stripes are diagonal. however  that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas  not very flattering  so back it goes.
1,This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy  comfortable  but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops  or polish it up with some cute boots.
-1,I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.
0,I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however  the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however  my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing  th
0,"This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace  substantial fabric  great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders  and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model  they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned  the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4""  120 lbs  and tried a size s."
-1,"Even on my 5'1""  short-waisted  100 lb body  this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back."
-1,I saw this dress online  and i thought it was perfectly cute! however  once i tried it on at home  it just didn't work. one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning  and once i got it on  the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm. (i'm 5'7'' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2). i didn't even try buttoning all the way. i took it back  and i don't even think i want a larger size. the buttons are just too fragile.
1,"Bought both colors - nice quality top  but they do run large. for reference  i'm 5'4""  115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs."
0,Love the wear of these jeans but they run small! designed holes have grown much larger-i don't dryer dry them.
1,"This is a beautiful dress! the color is really great and i love the cut - flattering around the neckline and loose and flowy.     the one downside is that it is pretty long. i am 5'6"" and usually somewhere between and xs and s for dresses  so went with the xs. the size is great but it's just a tad long for wearing with flats. i actually think if i was bustier the length would be fine  but since i'm pretty flat there's nothing to fill the dress! i wish i had been able to snag a petite  but they w"
1,These pants are a life saver. i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink  rolled in a towel  and hung dry with good results. picro does not usually fit me well  these pants are the exception. i'm 5'6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length. great for a baseball game! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them!!!!
1,This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however  it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side  but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale  so i am keeping it.
-1,"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9""  so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect. i loved the"
0,This is such a great dress  i hate to return it. it's pretty  a nice material  and an interesting cut. but like other reviewers have said  it is just enormous. if there were a size smaller than xs  or if it came in petite  i would exchange it in a second. but since there's not  it has to go back.
1,"I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background  with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does ""really pop "" and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . ."
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering
-1,This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately
0,Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!
0,"I thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case.  it is a pretty heavy  nice thick cotton and beautiful made. it does run large. i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5'9"" frame.   but - it is not white  it is beige  and it is not light weight. i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back  even though it was a great buy on sale."
1,Tis is a soft  soft cotton shirt that is comfortable and cute. it's a great top to use put on and go. i'm looking forward to wearing it often!
-1,After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black
0,"It's ok  fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide  hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 an"
1,I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store  but it's usually from a return.
0,It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.  i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite  i'd try it.  it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.
1,Great light weight sweater. perfect for spring. runs true to size. definitely will buy another color.
0,I really love the look of this jumpsuit  casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and  similar to another reviewer  proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture  but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows  and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
1,I tried this on at antho today and loved it! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors. it is flattering in person. the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer  but this is probably better anyway with spring coming (it is coming  right?-today it's snowing) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it. it is versatile and could be paired with anything.
0,I wanted to love this dress. i've been looking for a cute  flattering red dress for ages and snapped this up on sale online  thinking it was finally the one. when i tried it on i found the shape flattering  even to my recently pregnant figure. other than that  i was highly disappointed for two reasons. one  quality issues  as mentioned by a previous reviewer - the slip is sewn in totally unevenly  resulting in it sticking up above the neckline on one side  with several threads poking up above th
0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.
0,"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality."
-1,I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.
1,"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite."
1,I love the color  it has a lavender hue. it's slightly see-through  but breathes nicely and is very soft and comfortable. it falls long in the back and fits slim through the torso.
