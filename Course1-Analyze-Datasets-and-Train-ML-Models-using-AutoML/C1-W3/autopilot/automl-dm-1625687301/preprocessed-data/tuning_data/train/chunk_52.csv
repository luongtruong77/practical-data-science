0,I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7
0,I wish this fit more to the body  it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful  so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.  fabric is light for summer  so if you are thin  not muscular  perhaps that would look great?
1,This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.
1,I'm a 0/2 on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive  which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups  adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.
0,It was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom. the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt. i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it's definitely not worth $60.
-1,I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy  but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide  just awful.
1,Great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day - i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation. for reference i ordered a m and am 130 34b.
1,This top is very flattering and the silver line details give it a great pop of color!
1,"This is a great top! i love the color of the pink... it is the perfect color of pink; not too bright or too light  but a pretty pink-coral spring color! i am fair skinned and this color looks great on.  i got the 0 regular and it fits perfect. i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i usually get petite but i can't imagine this shirt being shorter... it's a great length. i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy. it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there. love it! perfect fo"
-1,This top is beautifully made and designed. material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out. i just found it not very flattering for me.
0,The embroidery on the side is cute  and they're nice and airy for hot days. however  the stitching on the legs unraveled after only two washes. also  they're extremely long; i'm 5'7 and had to take them up around 3 inches.
-1,Super itchy! had to return.
1,I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot  but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me  however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality  thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.
0,I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink. the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso  so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body... the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s)  it covered my flat hips  fits just like the picture  but now my hips are showing :( i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.
-1,Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful  but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.
0,I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures  a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.
1,I love this gown so much  i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy  beautiful  and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite  hands down.
-1,"Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3"" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip  but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price."
-1,I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build
-1,The dress is pretty  i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran  i took both back the neck is too tight!
0,I had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy. i love the lightweight material. i love the way it fits. however - all the seams are sewn  quite obviously  inside out. only after i received the navy shirt  where it is extremely obvious  did i check the mauve one. those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it wasn't really noticable. i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but  because i love the style and the fit  i kept it.
0,I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.
0,"This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said  ""meh "" so back it went."
1,At first  i thought this sweater might be too boxy  but fastened at the waist  it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing  and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.  but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas  and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.
0,I didn't want to get the black carissima because i already own the mona  so when i saw this gorgeous marguerite for sale  i had to bite. the main colors are chocolate brown  copper and rose pink--such a beautiful combination. the hook
0,I wanted to love this top  but had 2 major problems with it. first  it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt  which was terribly unflattering. second  the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.
0,Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.  oh well  it's going back!
0,This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic  that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses  and each time  the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room  if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner  it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!
-1,I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.
1,I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine  just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...
1,They fit me great  are super comfortable. they are casual  yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs. they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions. i love them with booties :). i think they look better in person than online  too
0,I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.
-1,I loved this shirt! flattering and pretty. it's hand wash only or dry clean. i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank  and now the front of the shirt is too short for me. would not recommend due to shrinkage... too bad.
0,Disappointed this didn't fit better. the pockets stuck out on the sides  and it was baggy through the middle. you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress. the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture. it's really pretty!
1,I love this tank  it is casual and comfortable  but has the little scarf attached to it  so sweet and styling. i tried on the xs regular  and would need petite  it was a bit long on me  but some people may prefer that. i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank. both colors are nice and neutral  good piece to add to a transition wardrobe. (115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist)
-1,I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however  in person  it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
-1,"The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the ""outside"" middle material  hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece."
1,I agree with other reviews  soft  cozy and love the embroidery and beading. it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse.
0,Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!
-1,I bought this top in the store  which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold  tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
0,"This is a beautifully made dress and i couldn't wait to put it on. i was disappointed. i am 5'5"" and a size 4- 6. i ordered the 6 and it was too 'long and heavy' looking on me. but the waist and upper body fit tightly. the zipper up the back was very heavy looking and the cut away shoulders didn't work for my body type  making me look bulky on top. the torso is really built for someone with small breasts - i am average and the way the darts are  made my breasts look flatter and lower than they a"
1,This t shirt is huge. i am 5' tall  size xs and i am swimming in this xs. i'm trying a size down. it is meant to be oversized but this is extreme.
-1,I wanted to love this dress  however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through  so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.
-1,Description is wrong. not a swing tunic. more long and straight. keep that in mind when buying this. if you have hips  this might not be the top for you
-1,I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit  and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.
-1,Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
-1,For me  this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person  and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.
0,This shirt is cute  nice cut  but i don't love it. best as a sleeping tank.
0,Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.
-1,This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all  the armhole is way too low! second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
1,I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.
1,This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy  comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.
-1,The cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined. although the color is beautiful  the cheap fabric has no variation  is too saturated  and lacks any sheen of quality silk.   shocked at the price. i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre 2010 . being back the quality!
1,Beautiful and chic. so glad i tried it on!
-1,I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.
1,I love the way these pants feel on. they are so comfortable and breezy. i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin. i purchased both colors; both are very nice looking. that said  i'm not sure if i will keep them. they wrinkle something terrible. i'm pretty casual person and it even bothers me. it probably wouldn't be so bad if there weren't pleats in the front. after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front. my husband said it's not ext
-1,This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..
0,"The fabric is wonderful  flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7""  145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch""  never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung"
1,Love my jeans  fit great and very flattering. they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit. receive compliments every time i wear them. if they go on sale i will buy another. :)
0,This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else  but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress  this will be a hard dress to wear.  the color is really lovely though!
1,This tee is very pretty - i purchased it in the grey/purple combo. i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i don't like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small.
-1,Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state  it is short and wide. i like the top so much  i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(
-1,"This is a really cute dress  just did not look flattering on me at all. i suppose i could have gone down a size  however i just did not love it. i am 5'3"" 130#  athletic build  36dd. i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress. here is what i did not like. there are pockets  which i cannot figure out the purpose  that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips. due to the shape of the dress  it bunches out. on my short frame  it made me look shorter and wider. the fabric is a lightwei"
-1,I really wanted to like this but the fit was just off. it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too. this one was just too much material. i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me. i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in  but decided in the end to return because i just didn't love it. the pink color and the fabric are nice   though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a 3.
0,This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver's seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and  in fact  recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don't think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat  i washed the top in a
1,This is a great staple top for your closet. its tremendously soft  a bit oversized  and drapes really lovely. in store there were also striped styles available  but i love the emerald green. the colors are absolutely perfect and will transfer well into any season! my only issue with this top (which inevitably is the reason i decided not to purchase) is the dolman sleeve. i'm al xl on top...so i'm never looking for extra width in anything i wear. the dolman sleeve really only looks right on me if
1,I purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long! the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print. the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual.
1,This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck  but i assume that will get easier with time.
0,"I saw this in that postcard ""catalog"" and it drew my attention immediately  so when i saw it at the store  i knew i would try it on.  this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things  the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy  but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7"" and it hit me right at the knee  so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring"
1,Love this dress and the color
0,This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering  especially from the side  but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute  but a little transparent.
