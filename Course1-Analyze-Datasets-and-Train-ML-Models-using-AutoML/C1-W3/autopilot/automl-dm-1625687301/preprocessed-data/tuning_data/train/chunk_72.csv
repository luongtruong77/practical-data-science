1,This is a really pretty top. the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on. i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle  not stiff. the top is kind of like a swing top  there is a lot of fabric  but it is just right. the fabric looks rich and lovely. great top!
1,I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish  but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online  and the fabric is so soft  it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely  and so it's flattering. overall  a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.
1,Dark burgundy sweater  cable pattern in front (subtle; hard to see online) embedded with panels of brown tweed in peplum section. beautiful fall sweater.  soft and comfortable. looks great with skinny jeans  would also look nice with a casual skirt or pants.  beautiful color.  slightly roomy fit (not fitted  but not boxy)...true to general size. love this for fall and winter.  flattering  comfortable  unique.
-1,No  but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8  a size 6 on top  8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online  but i saw this on naomi's blog  love taza  and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer  and while they only had a m/l  since i'm tall  i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like  it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model  and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well  so just looks  huuuge. i thought i was bein
-1,"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short."
0,Not that i don't recommend  only don't recommend if you have muscular thighs. so i tried on the small in plaid pattern (or checkered?) and not flattering on me at all. snug on the though and loose by the knee and below. also that pattern made my legs look weird  no kidding  kind of crooked... they are super comfortable and the small fit  so perhaps they run small?    i would get petite if you are usually a petite  the regular size bunched on the bottom  too long.    i am usually a 0p or 00p  or
0,This dress  it is heartbreakingly gorgeous  stunning. the entire idea and design is so gorgeous! the style with the sleeves  embroidery and slight shimmer at the top  two layers underneath  the dress is extremely gorgeous. i am so so so sad i could not keep it. i don't get why the sizes are so off here. i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight. i didn't want to send this dress back but it did not look good. it was just too loose. sad!!
-1,"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops.     the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online.     the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good.     they're also really tight compar"
0,"I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes  paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy!   it's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5'3"" - not so good - had to return  sadly."
1,These are the best leggings! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed; i didn't want to take them off. i'm hoping to get a few more pairs.
0,The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge  it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.
1,I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
-1,Unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big  too shapeless.
0,I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice  but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.
0,Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.
0,"This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5"" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p."
-1,It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn't for me.
1,"I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress. the fit is great and is made with great material. i am 5' 7""  110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress. the length falls right at my knee. it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit. a very cure feature. the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice."
-1,I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately  it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause  i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together  so the minute you put it on  one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f
0,The design is cute  but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also  the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron  you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.
0,Sheer and lightweight. perfect for summer. great detail could not justify paying full price.
-1,When i tried this top on  i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton  which  instead of falling by the hips  juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea  wrong material and placement.
0,This is the perfect day dress--loose fit  comfortable fabric. i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type  but the s actually was the best fit. i have worn it all summer and it's perfect for hot weather. just order smaller.
1,Great quality and beautiful color! i wear size 6 and ordered s. got lots of compliments :)
-1,The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.
1,Anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down  i have to buy it. fit is always so flattering  comfy and the prints are always great!
0,This is a pretty jump suit  true to size  looked flattering on me  lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however  the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work  so back it went to the store.
-1,"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10""  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect"
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need."
0,Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes  the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i
-1,This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular  curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.
-1,I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me  but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue  this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick  making it a bulkier shirt  then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say  this one was returned  sale or no sale.
1,"Great quality coat! very pretty colors and love the sleeves! i would have given 5 stars  but like other reviewers stated  this coat does she'd. best not to wear black. it is a slight ""swing"" style coat  so it's not fitted at the waist and hips  but very stylish. i found it best to size down. i'm 5'4 118lb  but i'm large chested (32dd) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest  but the six was too big. the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater!"
1,This top is very versatile. i wore it out to dinner with skinny jeans on a friday night  but it can easily transition to a saturday afternoon stroll around town top.
0,This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.
-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea
-1,When i saw this item online  i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized  comfy look to it. the pros: very soft the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo  the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on  it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured  that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature  but because it was so detracting  i had
-1,I really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on. the arms are so tight! i ordered in a m  which is my normal retailer size  but couldn't move my arms. took it back  was going to try in a l  but store didn't have any. for the price  i need to be able to move my arms!
0,I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me  the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes
-1,Gorgeous  but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return
1,This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt  but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front  or leave it open. great looking  casual but stylish and neat. a good grey  and a good blue.
1,"I love elosie sleepwear  everything is well made and beautiful designs. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 4  the small fits great. i love the embroidery it is a nice touch  and the pink is a pretty contrast."
0,"Love the way this dress looks online. sadly  it doesn't look great on me. i'm 5'4""  athletic build. the small fit perfectly  but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down. i really wished this worked for me  but i think you've gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off."
1,Got so many complements! really comfy but runs big! i'm usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small.
0,So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!
-1,"The model must have this sweater pinned at the back. the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything  but the fit is ??!! at 5'9"" with a long torso and broad shoulders  the large was still shlumpy. didn't hang right at all  bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering. my 5'7"" uber fit daughter had the same issue  and she usually makes everything that doesn't work for me look amazing. returned."
1,"I'm trying to buy more basic  versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that. definitely runs large-- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p. i'm  5'5"" and the petite falls where it does on the model. the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like. quality seems ok for the sale price."
-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!
1,Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3''  118lbs  and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!
0,Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft  easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket  can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
-1,The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
0,This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price  but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest  but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest  so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.
1,I love camisoles like this  and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length  so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted  but not tight.
-1,These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.
1,"So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5'10"" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesn't work. i think if you are taller this dress just won't work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem."
0,I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun  uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said  there are two issues i wish i had known about  although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also  the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr
-1,I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!
1,"Love this dress so so much! the wearability of it isn't much since it's such a ""wow!"" dress  but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for  itso perfect. if it were a touch shorter i'd be happy wearing it to the park. i'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it's so stunning long. the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying "" look how cool this is!"") ."
-1,Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy  way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.
0,I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.
0,Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress  i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
1,Love this shirt  can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!
0,I usually wear small  ordered xs and it's still way too large. quality not that great  just meh  returning it.
1,This is a flattering skirt for work or play. a few things to be aware of:   - it is a lightweight knit without a lining (would travel great and never need ironing)  - the waist is quite high   - the waist is quite slim (people with tummy self-consciousness might feel funny in it)  - the hang is flattering for people with butts and hips (such as myself)  - true to size for me    i decided not to keep it because i couldn't come up with enough tops to love it with and because for the money i would
-1,This sweater is adorable and comfortable  but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything. i cannot even imagine trying to wash it. unfortunately  i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor.
1,I love the style and the flow of this shirt. definitely worth the purchase and very flattering!
-1,Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue  not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress  however  the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it  but i returned it.
1,Absolutely gorgeous! i bought my regular size m and while it's a little wide in the shoulders  it drapes beautifully. because i'm so short  i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it's still elbow length and while i was there  she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame. can't wait to wear it - it's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet. so elegant. very gatsby 
1,Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy!! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton. i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly. but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery. i'd say it fits tts.
1,The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length  style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants  i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!
0,These are beautiful pants  especially when you walk  they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however  they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small  i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.
0,"Soft  cozy  and cute  but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only. for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money. i purchased the xs petite ( i'm 5'1"". 95 lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs  but i was ok with it being looser."
