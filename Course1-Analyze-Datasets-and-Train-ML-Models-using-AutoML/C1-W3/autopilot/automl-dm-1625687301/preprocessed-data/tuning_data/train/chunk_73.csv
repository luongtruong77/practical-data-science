1,I ordered an extra small. it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up. i've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels. really a cute and versatile sweater. i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful. this one works perfectly for me  however
1,"Very much in love with this ethereal  delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy  so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down  otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#"
1,I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8  my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.
-1,Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.
-1,"The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately  the 2nd suit i received was also ""off center"". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware."
0,I ordered this dress in coral. while i like it and the dress is nice  i have many other outfits that i like better so this will be going back to the store. i might have kept it in black or blue.
0,I love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing. i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help.  still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known.
-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref
0,I absolutely loved this dress  the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.
1,This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small  i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.
0,I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa  which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full
1,I received many compliments on this top. it's very cute and versatile. a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this.
-1,I loved the look of this top online - it had great lines. i was so disappointed when i received it.  it has zero support/lining and i'm not large chested to need a lot. it's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it  making it even harder to get off. it was returned.
0,Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in  but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well  and  as i am curvy  it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.
0,Thought this looked so cute  especially for averting frame. it arrived and was too large  the fabric felt super cheap  and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent.... and not in a good way. returned.
0,I had a really  really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it  i wanted to love it! in theory  it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however  as you can see for yourself in the photo  this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle
-1,This had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me.  it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy.
1,This dress is amazing! i love the collaboration with rifle paper. it has a nice boho swing look. i sized down from my typical small and took an xs. both fit well but i wanted the shoulders to be more fitted.
-1,I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately  this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the
0,I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness  simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles  pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it  consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.
0,First  i love moth clothing and own many  many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute  buttons run all the way down... caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when
-1,This dress runs very large. i am 5'4 and 120 lbs  hourglass  curvy build. i ordered a size small and its enormous on me. the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all. it's like a big wool sack. i'd have to gain 30 lbs for this dress to come close to fitting. i'm very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes  including petite. (i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available). the dress lo
0,I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking  especially the lace portion.   it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail  it balloons up right below the bust  making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.   i ordered size s  the smallest available  and it fit very wide more like a
1,Love these pants  they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all. so beware  if you are curvy  you might want to size up. great quality and style overall.
-1,I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size  this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e
1,The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops  but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly  but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price  it is worth tailoring.
0,I ordered this in the blue  it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back  but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top  but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted  34-d  5'3  125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.
-1,The dress is not the beautiful color in the picture...it is a very yellowish cream. the fabric is thick and does not  hang pretty. very disappointed. had to return it.
-1,Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections.
0,Yes  i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips  they balloon out.
-1,"1.) if you look at the 4th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back: this shirt is attached in not one  but two places in the back (in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached  or ""knotted"" in one place  and that is not the case). disappointing.   ----------  2.) unless you want to wear this as an off-the-shoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down. caveat: sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle"
-1,Wanted to like this type. cute print. something about the width and length of this top didn't work on me. was a little boxy. i'm 5'4  135lbs  size xs-s. might be cuter on different body type  i'm hourglass and athletic.
1,This top is awesome!! it is feminine and flattering at the same time! the color also makes it a little romantic. i will wear it with jeans or very a little dressier night out  black pants. buy this and you will not be disappointed!
1,I got this shirt in an xxsp  and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering  although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much  but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right  so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt.
0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.
-1,I wanted to love this shirt  but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered  but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.
-1,I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week  but i'm glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn't sure if i'd like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn't end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don't match up from the
-1,Material cheap. too small. good idea for design. love princess cut but bad material. good idea though. sending back
0,This is a gorgeous top; however  it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
-1,I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure  but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.
1,I laughed to myself  as i pulled these jeans on in the dressing room  expecting them to look ridiculous. instead  i was amazed at how well they fit  how cool they looked  and how comfortable they were (two sizes smaller than my usual).  yes  this 66 yo woman rocked these jeans!  i love the intricate whiskering  raw leg opening  and worn  dirty wash.  usually i do not like the dirty look  but this is good dirty. try them on:  you may just fall for them.
1,This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large.   definitely recommend.
0,Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large  but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far  i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos  the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he
1,"These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5' 8"" tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly  and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!"
0,"I'm 5'2""  weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return."
-1,I love this brand  i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap  reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin  and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath  you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black  and am keeping it only because i love the design  need a black top desperat
1,"I waited in anticipation for the turquoise version to appear online. turquoise and red can be found on another product page with the same name.     size: i'm between small and xs for most retailer brands. i wanted this top to be a bit more fitted  so i ordered an xs. i'm 5' 5"" tall  135 lbs  35-29-36  34d  with long torso and narrow shoulders.    fit: xs is spot on for me. i don't really mind the shorter length. it didn't appear to be too boxy. i layered a white shapewear tank underneath to help w"
-1,I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape  i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff  and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.
1,Most of my jeans are ag. love the ankle length and wash on these. not too distressed either. tts. really soft denim! size 27 like my other ag's
0,I loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear. they are going back to store.
-1,So disappointing! everything i've owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it.
0,I found this dress to run very large. the fabric was substantial but rather coarse. also  the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream.
1,I have three pairs of these in different colors (one pair is striped) and i love them. they are flattering and comfy. they go with nearly everything. can't get enough!!!!!
-1,I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl.  with sizing like this  one size fits all could just about do it.
1,"Not sure why this says ""online exclusive"" as i bought it in green in the store. i also saw it in a mustard color at another location. but in any case  this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!"
0,I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.
-1,"I wanted to love these jeans  but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these  they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say  it could be my body type  i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs  these could be great and work for you. i loved the color  dark blue."
1,Love the design and colors  runs a but large through the middle
-1,This skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.
0,The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty  but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest  it was very unflattering.
0,I ordered this sweater in green in petite large. the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably; however  the sleeves were very long for a petite. i roll them  and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve.
1,Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.
0,Thin rayon material. see-through and unlined. size down as this runs large. for reference  i'm 5'4  124lbs size 26 in jeans. in retailer clothing  i wear sz small or size 4-6. i ordered this in small  but the body and shoulders are too wide and unflattering especially with the shorter length of this top. that is why sizing is key. i know it is meant to fit loosely  but you will have to order a size down otherwise you will look larger and the dark piping details on this top will not fall in the rig
1,Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.
-1,It's sheer  the design /print is casual  but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
1,Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all  but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium  sometimes a small  but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!
-1,I loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them. unfortunately after washing the turquoise one  it sprang several holes. the same thing happened to the second one after one wash! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer  and they have washed and worn great. i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately. very disappointed.
1,I wear this top with jeans or cords. i allways get compliments. it's comfortable and versatile. go down a size!
1,Fun   flirty  feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear.
1,This top is extremely well made. the fabric is so soft. the style is very stylish. it is very figure flattering and chic. a keeper! i'm petite and the style is not overwhelming.
0,I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d  31 waist  38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said  even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first  it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back  get all four panels even  tied  hiding my bra  etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga  i may not have managed. once on  the style looked great. as
0,Beautiful well made top.it just runs small not for me
