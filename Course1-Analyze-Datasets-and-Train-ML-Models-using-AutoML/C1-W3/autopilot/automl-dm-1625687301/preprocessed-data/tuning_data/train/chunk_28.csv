1,This is an absolutely fabulous skirt. i cant wait to wear it. the biggest challenge is finding the best way to accessorize it. i am an artist and have lots of clothing  but haven't created that ab fab combo yet. i will!!!!
0,I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse  the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version  be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!
0,"The material of the dress is gorgeous  but the armholes droop much too low under the arms. in addition  i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow  exposing your ""chicken wings"" in an unflattering way. this is gorgeous on the model  so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot!"
-1,I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th
-1,I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail  i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape  material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.
1,"I love this sweater! i ordered the xs petite. it fits perfectly! it is soft. i hate itchy sweaters. the ""peach"" color is actually more pink  but i love the color. great buy! i'm ordering another one."
0,This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white  which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color  but i returned it since it was nothing special.
0,Love the style  weight (not too hot) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans. i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue. very disappointed
1,Even though this shirt is incredibly thin  i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year. it can be used as a swimsuit coverup  with white jeans in the summer  over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fall/winter. this is a great piece to own!
-1,This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top  but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously  i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.
0,"I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great.   the first time i pulled it out at home  i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side  the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for"
-1,I'm so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit  great color  so comfortable! however  i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so  now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable.     i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference  see my stats. i bought a 26.
-1,This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size  it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.     the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.
0,I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didn't met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt  it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.
-1,Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long  stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...
-1,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.
-1,"If these jeans work for you  you're a lucky girl! the fabric is really thick and soft. pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail. i ordered down a size. they're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30"" inseam. the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway."
-1,I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
-1,I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however  upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly. and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.
-1,The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
0,This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
1,Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you
0,I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason  this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
0,Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!
0,The dress is nice  but i was not excited about the color. the only color is this blue. also everyone has their favorite fit. i think i like some other fit better. my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials. otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit. i like to own dresses made of more natural materials.
-1,I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric  it is tacky!
1,Found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif (pictures don't do it justice) in-store and to my surprise  it actually fit! of course  it was billowy since i'm short/ 113lbs.  and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet  which i don't mind. i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on. the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits..like normal women usually have. ladi
0,"I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a ""cotton-rayon jersey"" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back."
-1,Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful  the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that's where the compliments end. it's an itchy  cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed.
0,Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty  but the shape isn't flattering  at least not to me. might work better on a teen?
1,Love the petroleum blue unique twist design love the sleeve length perfect for work -- neckline not too low great by itself or with a bib necklace and black jacket absolute winner
0,The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however  the bottoms run so small. for reference  i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start  both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!)  i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly  i'm giving up and returning.   only order this suit if you're super  super tiny on the bottom.
1,This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.
0,Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out  and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah
0,"The high neck and ""square-ness"" did not work for me .. but might for someone else."
1,Very comfortable  well made  great with leggings or skinny jeans.
-1,I love the design and the fabric  but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress  but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted  who knows?)  so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric  it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
0,I really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too. something a little different than a plain white shirt. however  it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff (i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material?). if this goes on sale  i may purchase it again  but i did end up returning the shirt.
1,I wanted to love this top. unfortunately  the color & fit didn't work for me. i'm a 36ddd. the fit was ok  it even flattered my bust  i just felt the stripes didn't flatter my waist. this would be perfect for an athletic frame.
0,I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally  the bow did not cover my bra strap  likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.
0,"I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i""m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large."
-1,A $200 piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model. avoid ! mine went back the same day it came in the mail...
0,"Adorable top  but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top  also by maeve  but the sizing on that runs small  medium  large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more ""square"" in the torso  and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also  i didn't"
1,"I usually have to order a size up in ranna gill dresses because of tight bodices. i did this time and it's too big  so i would stay tts or size down depending on your bust size. color is more moss/olive (green with a gray undertone) than shown online. no liner and the fabric is a smooth polyester that feels more summer weight than autumn. gorgeous embroidery on the chest. teeny tiny neck button closure and fussy side zip. i am 5'3"" and purchased petite but it is still too long unless i wear my f"
1,"Was so glad i gave this dress a chance - it's adorable! it does run large. i am 5'6""  125lb and the 2 fits perfectly. it is super comfortable. i am taking away a star only because it doesn't have pockets - with all of the fabric - how were pockets left out?"
1,Flattering  comfortable  and a fantastically versatile color and style. if you'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model  i'd say that it's tts. the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark  slate grey. i've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors  as featured on the model. the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt  or under a blazer to work.    i've washed the garment once on the
1,Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight  especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you're busty/broad shouldered  size up.  it has a dreadful side zip  is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p  my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#.
-1,"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me  but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great  but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size  they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:("
0,Usually i am a huge meadow rue fan  but not this time. the print is okay  but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft. if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt  but since it was neither it was returned?
-1,Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.
1,These are beautiful and very comfy. they do run very large. i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small. the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results. the description needs to be updated to reflect this.
1,I tried on a regular size at the store  and definitely need petite (5'1.5'  115 lbs). the dress is comfrotbale  and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel. the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot  where hte muscles meet. there is alining  so not see-through. length was too long  why i need petie  also loose-fitting  i would like it more a little more fitted  jsut a bit.
0,"First of all  this top runs big. i'm 5'5"" 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small. this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me. the fabric is thicker than your average tee  and there's not much give  so it may not hang well on all body types. i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price."
-1,Looks much nicer in the photo. i expected a much higher quality fabric. this fabric truly felt cheap. i expected a nicer dress for the price. the fit was unflattering on me. sent it back
1,I really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt. fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places
0,I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
-1,I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.
-1,Looks fitted on  but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
1,Okay  so in terms of quality  i'm not sure these are really worth the price given i paid $18 for similar pants at a cheap 'teeny-bop' store  but i do love them. the legs are much wider than they look on the model but the shirring at the waist and the inverted tucks below the shirring make them hugely figure flattering. i found that they did run a little large but couldn't size down so i hope they don't stretch out. (bought xs  5'7  115lbs) the shirred waistband is a little loose but i like how t
1,Super cute and comfortable! soft fabric drapes nicely. i wear this with an orange skirt  white shirts or jeans. i get lots of compliments on this top and get more use out of it than expected! i'm so glad i tried it on! a nice surprise.
0,If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.
1,Bought these online - sale  and am really happy with them. soft and light material - feel breezy  like a beach pant should!
1,It's very pretty. i purchased mine in the floral. romantic floral. the peplum is true to photos. it isn't short as many are. the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.
-1,This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...
1,I love this top. it was cool on a summers day. i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine  not ruined at all.
1,I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but didn't want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.
1,I really liked these leggings  so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants  i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip.
