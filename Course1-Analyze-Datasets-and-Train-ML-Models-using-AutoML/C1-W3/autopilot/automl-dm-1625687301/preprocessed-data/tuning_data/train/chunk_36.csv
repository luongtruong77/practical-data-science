-1,This shirt runs gigantic and it's not even cute. i.'m done buying retailer online.
0,I was really pulling for this dress to work because it's beautiful  however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return. it's much higher on the model than in real life. the petite length was still far too long  so additional hemming required  otherwise fit was true to size (5'3  130 lbs  size 6p)
1,I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.
0,"Ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl. i'm 5'9"" and thought it was cropped  boxy  and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering. the fabric is light and is less like a blazer  more like a cardigan."
0,I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
1,"Everything about this dress is perfect...the material  style  and fit. flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'9"" and the length was just above the knee. you can dress it up or down. comfortable. i definitely recommend."
1,I love this top! it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short. i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho  flowy look. it is flowy on it's own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size. waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation!
1,This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.
1,Very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navy/black instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times (cardigan  tights etc) difficult.
1,"I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated- however they are sadly very true. let me be clear that this is a beautiful  comfortable piece of clothing- when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality. and while the pattern is interesting and pretty  the ""dark orange"" color i was expecting is actually a mud brown. i think it's unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket  but i digress. the"
-1,The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.
-1,I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price  they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim  pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right  and the tag sewn inside  was sewn with red thread and showed through  very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
-1,I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray  not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this.
0,"I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going  but it was not  it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference  i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me  not ""cool"" long like some other sweaters this season."
-1,The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.
0,I liked it online  but i didn't want to pay shipping for something i wasn't sure if it is good. when i saw one size 4 in the store  i was excited to try it on. however  it didn't quite meet the expectation. the dress fits a little loose (donna morgan size 2 fits me better)  and it is not lined at all. the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape. there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller. i love the blue floral print  but that is the o
1,Color is beautiful  fits perfectly  lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering. hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season.
0,I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though  so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants  but wanted to let you kno
-1,I tried wearing it  however  i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.  unfortunately  i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.  first  it runs small than the regular size.   it feels even smaller because my size is xs.  in addition  it tends to exaggerate a body line.  i am not quite sure why this happens  but maybe it is just the way this tank is.  if you are confident about your upper body posture  then yes  it would look very cool.  however  if you have thin postur
1,"This is a very comfortable  good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short  and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on  it's great.  it is not made in the usa  as stated. it is clearly marked ""made in mexico"" from ""globally sourced"" materials (i.e. not from the us)."
1,I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes  polka dots and sweet flowers.
-1,The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage  not at my natural waist  so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it  the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.
-1,I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
1,Cute and comfortable top. very cute top that i will have to wait a few months to wear (until it is cooler out)  but a great piece to pick up for a nice price! it is soft and comfortable with a generous amount of room  but not where you look too big. i ordered it in the blue  but really it is like a dark gray ? which does not bother me.
1,"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange""  but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans  but want to dress it up a bit."
-1,This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse  which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.
0,This shirt is nice in theory but you need to have pretty long arms to make it work. you also need to be average to tall in height.
-1,This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.
-1,I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot
-1,I recommend this product  but with the following reservations.     the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.
0,Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one
-1,The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
-1,It was huge. material looked good but was too bulky. will be returning it.
-1,"When i ordered this dress  i thought to myself ""hmm  it seems a little close to showing some side boob  but maybe that's just the angle of the photo."" flash forward to me trying it on in my home - ""yep  that's some side boob."" it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim  this might be a good look  but on a curvy gal with some boobs  it was obscene. also  i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands  so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning."
0,I wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose  body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.
0,Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).
-1,I had high hopes with the other positive reviews  but it didn't work on me. nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn't lay well  and didn't do my bust any favors. maybe better on those less pear shaped. hopeless on me.
-1,"I am 5 7"" 135 lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape . it was just big and frumpy . it went back ."
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.
1,This sweater is so cute and classic and i've gotten so many compliments it's so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm 10/10 recommend
-1,I'm disappointed in these pants  which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice  the fabric is too thin  and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them  so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit  they might wo
-1,I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
1,This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug  but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over  anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise  the top is great and perfect for summer.
0,The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
1,I'm very glad i snatched this up when i did. it is super soft and the perfect length. i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit. i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans. for me  i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist  but it might shrink in the wash. the armholes were nice too  and didn't gap.
1,Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.
1,Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.
-1,It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.
0,This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.
1,Fits pretty true to size  thick material  sits nicely.
0,I liked the cut and color. seemed like good quality. i'm 5'5 and theses were so long. i had to fold them up like 6 inches not to step in them
-1,This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short  but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
0,The sweater fits a bit awkward in the front. it draped more than i would have liked. also  the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching. returned the item.
0,I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.
1,This skirt fits true to size and sits on the natural waist nicely. i've paired it with black  and the contrast is very nice. the material is thick enough for winter  but will also work for the fall months  too.
-1,"I really wanted to love this dress  but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7"" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses. it runs small throughout  and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed  but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8 10 and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress  w"
0,The color of this top is lovely. however  i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.
1,In the quest to find comfy  cute  casual tops i took a change on this one. it's cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn't suit my coloring or body type   but i still recommend because it's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else's closet.
0,I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.
1,I bought this sweater on a whim in the store  without trying it on. when i got home  i decided it would probably lose it's shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later  desperate for something to wear  i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.    this is a great sweater. layered with a cami  it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow. it is structured  so it doesn't feel sloppy. it has w
0,I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist  however.
1,I bought this dress to wear to a rehearsal dinner. like other reviewers have said it is a true shift dress. i'm 5'2  114lbs and the 0 fit me like a glove. it was a little hard to get the top on because the bow is not detachable (wish there was a snap or something) but once on i was in love. i may have to safety pin my bra to the bow so it doesn't show because it kept showing when i tried on. overall a very beautiful dress.
1,The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!
0,"Cute pants  not for me. a petite size may have changed my mind. more like ankle pants on my 5'2"" frame and a bit large all over. that said  the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable. love the snaps on the waistband  classy casual."
0,Love the design  material  and color...the sizing as listed is waaaaay off (running small). returned to store (after purchase online) 3 times to get one that fits  which was at least generally easy :o
0,I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing  the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash  too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.
0,The dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable. i did look kinda matronly with my 34d chest. it's a good basic to have on your closet  but i ended up returning the one i bought. it didn't feel special enough to keep.
-1,The quality is good  as is the design idea  but  practically  it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy  it is stiff and very wide.
1,This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?
1,"Great material that drapes nicely. super comfy  feels cool but it's a thick material--not at all see through. so happy i purchased this. and super easy with the snap buttons  but the shirt is very well made and high-quality material. would look great on all sizes and shapes. i'm 5' 4"" and about 140  small chest. normally i'm a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt  though it's also made to be looser and longer. still  at 5' 4"" i'm not swimming in a m."
