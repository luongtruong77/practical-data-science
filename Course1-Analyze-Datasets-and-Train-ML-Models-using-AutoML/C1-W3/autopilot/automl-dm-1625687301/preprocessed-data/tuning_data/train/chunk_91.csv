0,I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.
0,Billowy top - perfect for casual comfort. the topic is definitely not raspberry-- it is a sunset orange. disappointed as i was going for a match. i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name.
-1,Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item!   however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad  but i still love retailer!!!
1,This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.
0,On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.
1,This sweater is very comfy and looks great with tighter leggins. beautiful color
-1,Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.
1,Loved this top from the moment i saw it. i was bummed that this top wasn't available in petite sizes  but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself. i purchased the xs. after receiving it and trying it on  it was big under the arms and waist area  i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes. i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect.
0,I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it  so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress  which is good for spring  but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you  the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.
0,I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly  these pants are going back.
1,I bought the white version of this beautiful top in the store yesterday  this romantic top is beautifully detailed  very soft  comfortable and flattering. there is a thin cotton liner underneath too. fits true to size with enough room in the bust to not be too tight.
0,Super cute but order at least one size up
1,I tried the gray pattern on in the store and it is very soft and pretty. the fabric has a nice drape to it. however the length was too long on me  so i came online to find it in petite  but most of the petite sizes are sold out in the gray. i shop at retailer because i like it that so many of their styles are available in petite  however the petite length sizes seem to sell out much faster than the regular sizes. i hope retailer will give us short girls a break and order more petite length sizes so
-1,"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny."
-1,I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are
1,Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs  which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully  too. i highly recommend this blouse.
1,I  sadly  only noticed this top once on sale. i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big  i would need the petite  so i had to leave it behind (115 lbs  30dd) - but it is adorable  can be dressed up and classy  casually with jeans  or sweetly  so many ways... love the subtle polka dots... oh well  i am sure i will find something similar i love!
-1,Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also  they run very big..!
0,I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white  but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.
0,This sweater is incredibly soft and pretty  but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture. i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck. i really wanted it to work  but it was just so impractical.
-1,I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress  but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift  and she was right. not worth the price on sale.
0,My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips  too loose in the waist  and too tight in the knees  and i don't have big knees. also  the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed  they seem to have a 32 inch inseam  and these were regular  not tall. basically  i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves  and very long legs for this jean to work.
-1,I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp  my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no
1,"I have athletic calves from running  so i really struggle with straight/skinny jeans. but these fit me just fine (and don't look like jeggings). i think the slit helps. i have a 29"" inseam and these hit just above the ankle. great find - especially on sale."
-1,"I was really hoping to like this  but it did not look the way it does on the model  at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors"
-1,Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!
0,I like the idea of the dress  just not the fit in the bust. i'm not particularly big (32c)  but it just didn't fit up there. i wish the dress had built in support because you can't really wear a bra.
-1,I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.
0,This top does sit weird  feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down  probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.
-1,I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny  thin  and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline
1,I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :)
-1,Really wanted to love  the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material  i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go.
-1,Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.
1,I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....
1,I love the look on this dress - feels great for a romantic night out or for a party.
-1,This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
0,I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great  if the fit works for you.
-1,Based on other customer reviews  i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however  the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.  they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy  so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo
1,"I bought this online in dark green after trying on the burgundy. i usually wear a medium (5'2""  120) but i looked better in the small in this jacket. the combination of very deep green  black and tan is beautiful. the cut is very flattering with the jacket open or snapped closed. it is nice enough to wear with black pants or skirt but looks just as good with jeans. i am in my 60's and this look is chic and fresh without being too ""young"" for my age. it's also very well made. i love it."
0,This dress had a nice silhouette  but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!
0,I loved the lines in this jacket  but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.
0,"Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6""  34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves. it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!"
1,I tried on the grey motif yesterday  and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved  and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs  and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms  so i generally wear a small  but i tried on the small  and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath  so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath  go with your usual size.
0,"I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted ""just another cover-up"". in the final analysis  even at $35 (30% off 49.99)  it just hung there. if that's what you're after  then this is for you."
-1,I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.
1,I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large  but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!
-1,It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the
0,I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors  but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair  the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach  detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it  and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co
1,I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is  as one of the reviewers said  like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress  and the top lays over it  not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped  size 14  and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.
-1,I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home  i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck  and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t
1,This dress is light  airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan.   this dress is a keeper!
0,Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater  did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus  it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
0,While this top is pretty  it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad  because i really wanted to like it.
1,Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.
0,Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area  waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.
0,I really like the style of this top  and it's delicate but well made  but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer  but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length  and ordered the xxs petite. also  you would have to cut the tag off if you d
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.
1,I was so excited to order this dress; however  once it arrived  i realized that the fit doesn't work for me. i carry my weight in my stomach and backside  and the dress clung to my trouble areas.
-1,Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second  it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third  need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.
-1,"These were great pants that fit well  had good rise  perfect stretch for my curves  and i was really happy to get them on sale. (i'm 5'10""  165lbs  with a pear shape).     after only three months of occasional wear (about once a week  at most)  and following wash instructions perfectly  they started deteriorating. the pockets are becoming unsewn  the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch  and the bottom hem is coming unraveled. these are the most low-quality horrible pants i've"
-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet
-1,I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear  i noticed threads coming out on the seams  but just on one side of one leg. this was irr
0,Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.
-1,I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference  i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out.     however  my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine  that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
1,Saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i'd give it a try. i'm always looking for comfortable skirts that aren't too tight around the waist. once i zipped it up  i knew it would be a keeper! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well. the material is a little heavier weight  but that's fine it can work for winter as well. it's soft  yet structured. the pockets are always a plus. if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors  this is out of the box
1,Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!
1,This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable  yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique  yet whimsical swimsuit style.
1,Love this top! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one. the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed. i am a 34d. this top looks great with everything.
1,I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket  but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room  order a size up. the quality is nice  i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me  just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.
0,The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price  i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing  so i am debating whether i should keep or return.
