1,I love this top and it's so pretty in person.  knew it would be full but was hoping it wouldn't be too big.  it's perfect and looks good with jeans.
0,Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.  they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it's hard to imagine a world in which they didn't make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don't look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh
-1,Online  this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact  i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately  this sweater will not work for me  as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.
0,I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just doesn't work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i can't
-1,While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.
-1,I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7  flat chested  135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer  because i do not consider myself tall.
-1,"Dress appears to be slim fit  but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3""  but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings  memorials  special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed."
0,I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge  i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.
-1,Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
0,I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.
-1,The cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing  let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.
-1,"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this"
0,"A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure  this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.  i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta  but definitely needed a large.  i ordered the ""lavender"" color  which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead."
0,I love the look of this top. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big  and looked a little like a maternity top. i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately  it still looked maternity-ish. i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all  it will look like a maternity top on you.
0,These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up  the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on  too  and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are  the better stripes look. they more curvy you are  the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.
1,"I have never looked good in a legging. stretchy denim ""jeggings"" are usually the most i can get away with. but i am amazed how flattering these are! the fit is great (i got a m cause i'm small  but curvy in my hips/butt)  the material is thick enough not to reveal too much  and the faux pocket in the back does a lot to make one feel less exposed. the length seems like it would be a great compromise between short and tall girls too -- i'm pretty short  but they aren't too long on me  there's a ve"
1,This is a heartbreaker! love this dress's colors  length  flow  beading  and style but its extremely tight in the shoulders and bust. hate to see it go back....
0,"Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away ""i love it"" and i just didn't. my husband looked and said it is just a ""blah"" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice  doesn't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'("" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o"
1,I've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i've looked in a long time! fitted  but skimming where i don't want to be accentuated - it's a rare dress that can pull this off! the cleavage is there  so i think it's more of a night dress  but i'd wear it with a sweater during the day. very comfortable.
-1,Really cute sweater  well made  but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !
-1,Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
0,This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.
1,Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all  which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.
0,I totally agree with the first review. i thought this was soooo cute on the model  but it's loose fitting and has no shape to it.
1,Love this shirt. the print is a little loud  but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however  that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty  if that helps. the red is short-sleeved  by the way if ordered online  cute and flattering.
0,Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat  even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!
1,"I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress  full price  in this condition. otherwise  the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect."
0,I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.
-1,This looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
1,I love this fabric  it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors the sapphire is great. i wish it would be offered in red  like the cowl neck long sleeve tee. with that said  i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd  and while i wish it were a few inches longer (3/4 sleeved). the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality.
0,"I really wanted to love this  but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref  i'm 5'3"" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area  but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it wasn't that i didn't realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back  but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look"
0,"Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26"" (so it is at least 2"" off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...we'll see!"
-1,This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
-1,This looked nothing like the picture on me. was long and very unflattering. belled out greatly at the bottom also. the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality. but overall awkward.
0,This is a nice dress  but i'm glad i tried it on in the store. not for women with bigger breasts. i'm 36d and size 10 didn't fit me on top. lace part was too short to cover the whole area. other than that color is great .
-1,I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving  clingy  and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time  i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.
1,"I have always had a thing for velvet  and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise. they are beautiful; exactly as pictured  but a bit longer in length on me. i am 5'3"". they can be dressed up  but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well. i am wearing them with a heather-grey t-shirt. they also pair well with the metallic linen tees. my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide"
1,Comfortable shorts. thinner fabric. pattern disguises underwear lines. love the exterior pockets  as i won't have to tuck them in when i zip up. as the previous reviewer said  the black and white pattern has blue accents. they're mid-rise and a longer length  which i appreciate.
1,"Loved the look of the blouse online but the one i received has weird pattern placement that i'm not a fan of. mine was mostly cut from the ""mum/sunflower"" patterned fabric and none of the pretty teal and red pattern. the shirt online as a good combo of patterns-- mine is a solid mrs. roper-all-over-flower print! way overboard!! that said-- the cut is cute and the yoke at the back is a nice detail-- hoping i can exchange it for one that looks more like the online pic!"
1,Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!
-1,"The fabric  colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy! i am 5' 9"" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!"
-1,"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess."
1,These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.
0,Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
1,Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.
-1,I loved this coat in the picture  and couldn't wait to get it. sadly  it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small  and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves  and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape  and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs  but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable  and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv
0,I do like the shape of this piece.  it is eye catching due to the length and flattering.  however  if you are chesty  this piece shows off more than i was comfy with  and i don't think i've ever had that problem with retailer.  in the body  i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it.  but up top  the xs showed much too much cleavage.  (34d  5'  115).  i'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this.
1,"I bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom. absolutely loved it! i am 5""2 so the dress is part is a bit long for me---ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit. the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures. but that makes it more formal. it's great!"
1,I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..
-1,Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.
1,Great addition to my cold weather wardrobe! comfortable and has the slouchy look  but still nice enough to wear to work.
-1,I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon
1,Love love love. fits great. super comfortable and looks both casual and dressy at the same time. i could wear this every single day.
0,I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....
-1,I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer  actually)  the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion  and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small  but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
0,Purchased on sale  would have never purchased at full price. runs small and runs short. will be returning.
0,Wish this worked for me! i am 5'9''. it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot. the neck was kind of tight on me too. i love the idea of this dress but need it longer. the dress is very roomy overall.
1,I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings  and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin  i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
0,These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans  and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.
-1,I don't normally write reviews  but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!
-1,Very disappointed. ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
1,They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.
-1,"Like another reviewer mentioned  this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also  the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly  it's going back!"
0,I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
0,I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering  but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side.
1,I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.
1,I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.
0,I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!
-1,This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color  it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white  needless to say it went back.
-1,Beautiful color  design and fit.  but i couldn't wait to get it off.  i don't have sensitive skin and don't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool.
1,These jeans fit so well and are made of really high quality denim. soft and comfortable but not too much stretch...just enough. i'm short so i have to cuff them. i kinda wish they came in petite or ankle length  but they look cute cuffed too.
1,"This sweater runs large and long in the arms. i am 5'5"" and often wear petite in pants but not tops. the medium petite is perfect  the sweater is a beautiful open gauge knit and will be great this fall/winter for work over a tank and nice pants. the blue color is more of a mint green/blue  very pretty and different than anything i have in my closet. great addition."
