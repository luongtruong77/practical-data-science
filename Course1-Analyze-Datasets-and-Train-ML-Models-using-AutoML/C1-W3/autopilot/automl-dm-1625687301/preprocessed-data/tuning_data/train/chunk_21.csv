-1,"I ordered this in a 4 (34b  140lbs.  5'8"") because it looked like it would run big  and it definitely does! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs. heavier than i am. i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy  so i returned it. that said  the material is gorgeous!  as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person. if i had a straight(er) silhouette and a larger bust  this dress would have been a"
-1,I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight  and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me  but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe
0,"Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very ""retailer"" piece so most likely i will keep it  just a bit disappointed."
1,This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it. i am probably between a small and xsmall  but ordered the xsmall. it is snug  but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath  just in case the buttons gap just a little. i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping. it is also a little snug in the elbow area.
0,This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not  so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts  especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute  ver
-1,I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
1,I would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in. they are attached on the inside by a string. if the string broke the pockets would dangle. for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest. too bad.
-1,I've been waiting to purchase this top for some time  thinking it would be perfect weight for fall/winter. i'm pretty disappointed. since i don't live close to an retailer  i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal  this sweater however i was swimming in  like a child in an adult sweater! it was huge! and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape. i wasn't impressed with the material either  it f
1,I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater. it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater. the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed. but overall this is a lovely sweater!
1,I am super happy with this purchase. this top is so soft with a nice amount of flow. i'm wearing it with a bolero sweater over it  making it wearable in the fall and in cooler weather. i also purchased this top in the gray/green shade and it lovely as well.
0,This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.
0,For my body type  this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e.  boobs) this would work better.
1,The dress is very pretty! i ordered for a wedding and thought it was a little casual for that. in the end i returned because it wasn't very flattering for my figure.
-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.
0,This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me  not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker  but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design  just not the right material or fit.
1,I love the coral color! allows me to add color to my neutral wardrobe! very flattering!!! i get a lot of compliments on them!
1,I really liked the beautiful fabric  design  and length of the piece.
0,Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper  trouser-like pant--this is not it!
-1,I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also  didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.
-1,I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.
0,"Beautifully made. beautiful drape. deep  blue. so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in. why is it so long???? in 5'6"" and got a large. with 2 inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls.   ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt. may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess"
1,Love cloth and stone. this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured. soft and casual  with great design details.
-1,I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears  they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating.
0,I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however  i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale.
0,The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
-1,I want to love this shirt  i really do  but it's huge! the top is tent-like  which would be adorable with skinny jeans  however the length of the back dips so low  the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful  more like a light grey heather  and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall  the top is cute  but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt  so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly  it's a return.
-1,I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top.     here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom  though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let
1,Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape  but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long  but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
0,Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
-1,"Was excited to try this interesting skirt  as a mega bailey 44 fan. however  this skirt didn't fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i'm not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren't flattering to the body. the ""vegan"" quilting isn't luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn't lay to advantage when worn and i'm an easy fit. length is so-so "
1,I purchased this top as a swim suit cover-up and it is perfect! i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true. great product.
1,I just bought this dress today  and it is absolutely stunning. it looks so much better in person than on the model. i think it runs true to size  however it does have relaxed fit. overall  the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow  without adding bulk. great buy!
1,"I *love* this tunic. i'm 5'5"" and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings. it is so soft and comfortable  and i love the pink color--very versatile. my favorite thing about this piece--i am a 36dd and haven't bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic  which fits over my chest and is so flattering! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large--i agree  but for those of us who are busty  it's an opportunity to wear a cute  breezy style with buttons and a collar!"
0,"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the"
-1,I ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it. the color was just as pretty in person. the thick eyelet panel was well done. the problem is the whole tank was much smaller/tighter than pictured. i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit. i'm pear-shaped  so the hip area looked terrible. but  the whole top just wasn't up to the typical fitting standards for xl. retailer has done much better in the pas
1,Love the design! fabric is very light and flowy. i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage. runs a little wide. size down. such a fun top  i've had tons of compliments! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small.
-1,I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.
1,First of all i love retailer  i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller.
1,I found this today on the one and only rack. i absolutely fell in love with it. i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly. other customers were asking where they could find it in the store. i highly recommend. it can be dressed up or down.
0,This blouse runs large  billows out slightly  and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty  the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless  i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it's light weight.
0,"I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease  modern look  and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years)  but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this ""easy"" skirt  and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi"
0,I was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season. i wasn't sure what i thought when trying it on  but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it. for me the waistline was a bit high  and it had a bit of a frumpy feel. i love the floral pattern but overall it just wasn't amazing.
1,I love this top! it is modest enough for work  but fun enough for weekends. soft  comfortable  and lovely pink color. i want it in every color! (it seems to only come in two colors  though.)  soft flowy fabric  is lined with a soft inner fabric as well. super flattering for any body type!
-1,This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!
0,This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft  but poor material. not my favorite purchase.
0,"First off  the dress quality is great  the fabric is very nice  the color is great. i am 5'4""  150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me  very unattractive  because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant."
-1,I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on  but i did and found that  for me  the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
0,The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.
0,Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress  but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite  also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit  but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.
0,The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.
0,"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8""  180lbs  36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!"
-1,I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.
-1,I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed. i tried it on and i was correct....it looked like i was wearing a huge tent. i returned it.
-1,I love the pattern adn color combo  but  wow t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway  not for me  but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad.  length was decent in regulat size though  not too long. just too wide.
1,Love this top!! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it. i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame  but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out. also  this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles!
1,"I love this dress! the beading gives it something special and the petite fits my 5"" frame perfectly. lightweight enough to wear now and again later with layers for fall. very soft fabric!"
0,The material looked much nicer in the online picture. also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me.
1,I loved this dress immediately.  i got the blue and orange and love the combination of the top fabric and the flowy skirt.  only one complaint.  it's a bit short on one side so i'll have to wait for cooler weather to wear it with tights (if i want to wear it to work).
-1,I was so excited to try this on in the store  because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately  it is not like the picture. the material is very thin  almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i'll skip this one.
0,Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining  as mentioned by the other reviewers  is awesome)  but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses  it has no structure  and it's not a good look on someone a little busty  as i am. in all honesty  i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium  size 6-8  and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to
1,This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering  fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 132 pounds  34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper.
0,This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all  i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.
-1,I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad  because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...
-1,"This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame  small-busted body.  i am 5'2"" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy  if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty."
-1,I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
1,I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.    great buy
1,Very slimming  lovely dress.  a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe.  the embroidery is lovely  fabric soft and comfortable. sized perfectly.   so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!
1,Very cute and flattering. very fitting in legs and thighs and i have fairly slim legs. i am a size 6 and 6 was very snug. i recommend trying these on in store or trying several sizes to see best fit.
-1,On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
1,The blouse is lightweight and is double layered  meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1  a bit busty  and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.
