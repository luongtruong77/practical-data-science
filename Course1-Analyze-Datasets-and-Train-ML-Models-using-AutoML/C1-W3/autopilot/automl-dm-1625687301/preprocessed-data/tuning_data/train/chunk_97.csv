0,"I really wanted to love this dress....     i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly  the top was just too ""balloon like"" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it."
0,I ordered this dress in two sizes  pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also  the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the
-1,"These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6  and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said  the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff  and the sheen made them feel cheap  unfortunately."
1,This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive  it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value  is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and  in addition to looking great does keep you warm.
0,"I'm all over this trend  but this vest is quite thick/poufy  and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball. i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best. on me  a sweater vest would perhaps be better. i am chesty. but i cant decide. its really cute! if you're taller than 5'4"" don't hesitate."
1,Cute to wear with leggings. i like that it's easy to just throw on. it's fitted at the top and easy to chase kids around but doesn't look too momish or sloppy.
-1,The dress is very pretty  but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold  given the photo  but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.
1,This is a stunning dress. fits true to size  very high quality  has a very flattering shape  and the lace embroidery is gorgeous.
0,Dress cut was great  but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age.
0,This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.
1,Very cute dress for 5'5 or taller
0,"I loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered. the length was good for me (only 5'4""). the elastic top fit well (32b) but then from there it was too much fabric. i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight a-line but it was just a huge amount of fabric on me...several inches on both sides big. i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf"
1,This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room  so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so  so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.
-1,I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.
-1,I wanted to love this  was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful  but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top  and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back  in the back  because it does not lay flat like that in front  it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.
1,I just received this dress and i'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up. i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly. the color is beautiful and the dress is unique. can't wait to find a special event to wear it.
1,Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair  these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long  so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend  i'd go with these!
-1,After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo  from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
0,This top is pretty and i'm sad it didn't work out for me. i'm 5'9  145 lbs and i found it to be short and boxy in the torso (tried on a s  m and l). also material in the front is super staticky - i hate that feeling.
-1,If you have anything larger than an a cup  this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower  it would have been perfect. for reference  i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.
-1,Thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8  usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me.
0,I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is
-1,I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee
1,I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer  and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think  120-lb marathoner)  and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th
-1,Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse  only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).  this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though  and the sleeve concept is cute. however  where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.
-1,I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer
0,This dress is very cute and is made well.  i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust. this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a 14. i was surprised that the 14 was sung in the bust. and then understood why the 16 was sold out. i was 30/40 lbs heavier when i wore a 16..never would have thought i'd have to order up that high. i've been running a 10 or 12 depending on the level of my activity. i'm keeping the dress because i kn
-1,"I so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can't work on me!"
0,I ordered this in lime  which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy  and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist  i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room  i had to plan ahead.     i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.
-1,"This top is really beautiful  but looks absolutely horrible on my 5'9"" apple shaped body. in the words of my husband  i looked like a star trek villain."
1,This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft  comfortably loose  but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!
-1,"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available."
-1,I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you
1,"I almost passed this in the store  but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker  so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room."
1,Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.
-1,The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.
0,I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown  but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere  which just seems wrong in this style pant. also  take note  these are slit up the side  which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit  but still  does c
-1,As soon as i saw this dress  i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it  i noticed it was slightly small  but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it  but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one  but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i
1,"I love the contemporary style of this piece  but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms  it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces."
0,I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater  but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.
0,The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.
0,"This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that  but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back  because i didn't say ""wow  i love this"" w"
1,Got this top in the blue/orange plaid. its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirt. i highly recommend it!
0,These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort  they are a five. but after only two wearings  they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price  i'd be more upset.
-1,Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
1,"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me  i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10."
-1,White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.
0,I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i
1,Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats  boots or booties. true to size. for reference i am 5'9  138 with an athletic build.
-1,The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.  also  the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.  needed to return
1,These are probably my 10th pair of pilcro legging jeans  and though i love the color  sort of a worn in  soft black/ dark gray  these particular pair fit a tiny bit more snug than any of my others. it could be the fact that these are ankle length vs most others are long with the cords being extra long and cozy. so i wonder if the fact that these are shorter they tend to sit on my legs a little differently. it may also be just this pair was cut a tiny bit smaller. i am toying with the idea of ask
0,This is such a cute design  but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big  it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.
0,I purchased this top in white and lavender. the white is very nice  soft and semi-sheer but not completely see-thru (fine with a nude bra). it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front  but i expected that. i purchased a medium and it's plenty roomy. i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit.   the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven. it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional  b
1,I purchased this online and absolutely love this:::: it can be dressed up or down. i received many compliments  its also so soft and very comfortable!!! a must have!!
0,I loved this top when i saw it online  and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately  the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small  and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest  i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top  but it just won't work for me.
0,"While i loved the material  color and concept of the dress  it was much too large and sack-like. i'm 5'2"" and 108 lbs  pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right  it was just much too large throughout. i'm not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly  this will be going back."
0,I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color  the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach  in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors  just watch getting water or anything else on it!
1,This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression  wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done  pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long  so i will have to hem.
-1,"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3""  but it fe"
-1,So  ordered online. tried this on  boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes.   back it goes. super cute but huge.
-1,I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment  it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
-1,"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic  but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling  ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer."
0,I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model  however  not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.
-1,This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site  so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug  cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty  its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.
1,Gorgeous detail on the sleeve. adorable pattern. unfortunately  it is a little too cropped & it's not actually sleeves. it's a cape style. wasn't expecting  but still really cute.
1,Versatile and comfy. can be worn with shirts underneath for multi-seasonal wear.
1,I love this skirt  wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size  which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.  anyway  ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight  like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist  so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute
1,I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.    the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.  so glad i made this purchase.
1,If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans  leggings  sandals  boots  and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!
0,I really wanted this to work. the style and colors are great and it is comfortable too. i didn't like how big the skirt portion was or how stiff the fabric was. it looked like a plaid tent on me but not in a terrible way. it could work on the right body.
1,My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.
