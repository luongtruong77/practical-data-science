-1,I love the idea of this top  but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
0,Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type.
1,I love this sweater  it's so soft  and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size  but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more  it seems to stretch a little. overall  i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!
0,I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping
-1,Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.
1,"This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer  i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4""  usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash."
1,I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!
1,Everything about this top is perfect! quality is great which is number one in my book. color is awesome! perfect color for fall  summer and spring! a must have!!
1,Fabulous dress!  clip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back (you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer).
1,"Really pretty for summer  especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top  so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on  and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it  since it's really pretty for a summer party."
-1,Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.
-1,Pretty color  but i was hoping for a thicker  higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.
-1,"I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs."
0,This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.
-1,It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy  unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy  rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print  though.
0,It looks great on the model but not on me. on me  it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.
1,This lovely number met all my expectations. ordered an xl  and glad i did. the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out. if it was available in another classic color  or a subtle neutral pattern i'd probably purchase a second one (hint hint retailer).
0,After losing a lot of weight i thought i'd try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand  i bought my usual pilcro size but wow. these are just way too tight. they pull on like leggings or tights  clinging to every part of your leg - there isn't even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big. i kept thinking i'd just lose more weight and they would fit better but that isn't happening either (the fit) so these are going to my daughter who
1,I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs. her clothing is intricate  boho  colorful and fits like a dream. when i saw this online i had to have it. it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be! the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic. the dress definitely has some room  but it isn't quite as swingy as the catalog photo. i have a lot of curves  so it may be swingy on a more slender figure. i ordered an xl mostly because of the s
1,I have this in the blue/teal color  and i love it  so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy  comfortable  and soft  even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs)  although it's a bit form-hugging  so if you want a looser fit  consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it's not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!
1,This is an amazing dress. beautiful fabric and color. comfortable too. it's like wearing air. sorta chameleon like because this print  literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on. it's slimming too. i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body. the back is completely open. it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view. the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer  which is slightly snu
1,The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.    very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!
-1,"Sizing is just getting unreasonable  and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model  but on my 5' 4"" 115 lb frame  the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally  the shirt looked like it shrunk in length  and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22"" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i"
0,This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?
1,I absolutely love this jacket. as a 36 year old woman  i want items that are on trend but don't look juvenile. this jacket hits the nail on the head for me.
-1,I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that
0,This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
-1,I loved how this looked on the model  however  once i tried on in store  i was greatly disappointed. i usually wear a meduim and the small and extra-small were huge on me. there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this. i had such high hopes for this. there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped.
-1,Well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
-1,I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat  the fabric is light and breathes. however  pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.
0,"Fit and style very nice. returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming. they were at least 4"" too long. i am 5'8"" so heels would fix the issue but i don't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants."
-1,As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.
-1,This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.
-1,I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !
0,It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .
0,"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately  the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small  as this coat appears slightly more snug on top  a-line on the bottom  with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back."
-1,"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin  it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78  it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?)  but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b)  so it did nothing for me..  also  the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green"
-1,On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.
0,I only tried on the ivory one  but it was so see-through  there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size  maybe a little large  but that's the style. very cute design  loved the back. too bad.
1,"The navy version of these pants are beautiful. the contrast gray stripe is subtle and slimming  and continues through details in the pockets.    i am 5'6""  34-26-38 and i wore a size 4 regular and 4 petite. the regulars were very long  and even heels couldn't help them. the pant leg covered my foot  covered my toes. the petites were much better (and i rarely order petite). they hit the bottom of my foot with no heels  so i think a heel would make them look right. i'm just not sure if the petite"
-1,I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak
-1,I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning.
1,This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.
0,"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace  while pretty  to be quite rough  which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference  5'5""  125 lbs  34d. sad  but this went back."
1,"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey  which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!"
1,This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.
-1,The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.
0,The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.
1,I love the dress overall  however  found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall  a beautiful dress to own.
0,I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn't realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also  the fit is loose  maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress.
-1,Ditto what the first reviewer said  unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar  i suspect  to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
0,This top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas  it's going back.
0,I loved this vest from the moment i saw it. sadly  though  it runs way too large. i first ordered it in a small and then an xs when it popped back. even the xs was too large around my shoulders and waist. the color was also a bit more beige than in the photos  which was ok  but i had to return it because of the size.
1,Super cute dress - swingy  flattering  easy to wear. the pattern is great  and i felt like it was the perfect length for me - though i'm short  so it may be too short for someone taller. the dress runs big. i'm usually a 6  but i got this is a 4. only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk.
-1,I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer  however as the previous poster mentioned  the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
0,"I wanted to love this romper  but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium  decided to return. i still recommend trying this product  but it wasn't for me and my hips!"
1,Such great detail great beautiful in red and white.
0,"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs  i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees  instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length..."
1,Although it kind of ran big and the material is stiff causing some protrusion off my shoulders  i decided to keep it only because it was unique and still looked cute
0,So  this is a super soft comfy sweater. the color is great and i really wanted to love it. but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me. that being said  all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it. the neckline is also really neat. it drapes nicely  and stays that way. if you are on the fence give it a try!
1,After reading reviews  i ordered a medium instead of a large even though i am typically a size 12. it was definitely the right decision. a very flattering dress in a beautiful color. if you order in the right size  it is not at all dowdy. it is forgiving in the belly area  which is great for me. it can be worn with tights or without tights  so really quite versatile. i am sure that i will wear it a lot. also  it is very comfortable.
1,"This tank is really thin and airy without being too flowy. it was perfect for my soul cycle workout  and i am thinking about getting it in different colors for working out. i don't know that i'd normally wear this top on its own because it's very casual  but it's perfect as part of a workout or vacation outfit. i sized down one size to make sure that it wasn't too flowy  and it fit perfectly. i am 5'2"" and 130lbs.  and a size xs fit perfectly."
0,Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.
0,"I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model  it's a little bit frumpy  but it was so pretty that i tried it. however  on my short frame  it's even frumpier. the quality is very good  the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4""  110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p  but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a"
0,I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however  the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality  but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
0,"I am allergic to wool and have a hard time finding winter sweaters. was really excited when i read material content on this item only to be disappointed upon arrival to note that sweater is 10% wool. also found it to be very tight in arm area. for reference i am 5'10""  130 lbs. and would say have slender arms! cute design that will work for some!"
-1,Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.
1,"I just received this dress in petite extra small. for reference  i am 5""7 and 118 pounds. to answer the previous reviewer's question  the regular size of this dress runs long. if you want it to look like the one in the video  then order it in petite. i personally love the style and the material. however  the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it."
1,Love this jacket.  it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time.  i was surprised at how affordable it was.  my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color.
0,This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium  both fit  one tighter--obviously  but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body  smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c  athletic build.
-1,Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.
-1,This sweater is so cute and seems high quality. i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste  going down just below my mid section. i wish it had been cut longer- i would have kept it.
