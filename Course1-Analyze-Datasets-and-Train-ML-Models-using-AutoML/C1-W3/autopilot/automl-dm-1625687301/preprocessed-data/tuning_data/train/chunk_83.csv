0,This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning it.
0,This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.
0,I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch.    i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size  but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long  yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is  it makes me look like i have short legs.    also  the collar won't stay down  the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi
0,The positive: light-weight fabric  interesting drape  the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.
-1,I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous  like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential  but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.
0,I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately  they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords  i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down  but now i'm wishing i had  although i'm not sure that would make a difference.
1,This top is so cute and i immediately had to purchase it when i saw it. i am usually drawn to boxy  cropped shirts  but i find this is harder to wear than i anticipated. it may be because i got a small size  but it is boxier than i anticipated and is almost hard to wear with even jeans. i recommend you buy because the detailing is so pretty and perfect  but try on and make sure you have some good bottoms to pair it with!
0,I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful  the embroidery is well done  the fabric is soft  and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath  but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.
0,Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however  when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back  so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would.
-1,This top looked so cute in the picture  but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received  actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker  and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side  and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips  there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.
-1,I absolutely love mother jeans  but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too  i always size up in white jeans  and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother  and ordered a 29 in these.
0,"The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b  150 5' 9""  tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric."
-1,This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
0,Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe  but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft  cozy  and cute  though.
1,Great looking  please dry clean it or you'll ruin it  fits well  easy to make an outfit look stylish
1,Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.
-1,The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.
0,I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--  the description said it was black and white.
-1,"I ordered a size small. i am 5'7"" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high  so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft  thick  stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back."
0,"I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.  it runs quite large  in my opinion. i'm 5'7"" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light)  but i don't think this is a problem  necessarily. had it been thicker  it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip"
0,Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large  which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.
-1,There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design  and anna sui  but this is just so overpriced.
-1,Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small  medium and large on and huge huge huge  boxy  fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it's way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing.
1,Absolutely amazing! a must staple in every one's closet this season. i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel. the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on
1,I was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first.  i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum.  kind of an unnatural placement.  i sized up so it wasn't so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better.
0,I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!
0,I bought this (because it looks beautiful  is well made  and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on  it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead  it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi
1,I am not usually one for super girly tops  but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down  i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it's perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!
1,I am 5'7  115 lbs  and tried on a 0. the dress (red) looked great and i loved how it had a slimming effect  and i could wear this to work and the length is appropriate. it fit great  but it was a pain to get out of for some reason. i tried to get out of it through the bottom  but it kept getting stuck on my hips. i eventually got it out through the head  but it was such a pain that i just got frustrated. the fabric is okay- i expected a slightly better quality fabric for the price.
1,"I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it. it wasn't available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online. i'm 5'6"" and about 175 lbs; the medium fits perfectly. i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos  maybe this hangs out/mellows over time. the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days. can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding. the pattern is bea"
-1,When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected  especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse  but i will be returning it becau
1,"I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely  but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3"" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops  this is for you. unfortunately  i had to return it."
-1,I like the design of the dress  but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress  i had expected better quality.
-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
1,I have these pants in a larger size  but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller size.  they are so comfortable and soft and go with everything.  keep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear them.  just wish they would be available in tall!!!
-1,This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!
1,"I tried on the regular size at my store and it was too long for me  te sleeves were enourmous  and the dress fell mid-calf. but  i love the feel of hte mateiral  and if it were to fit properly  is very falttering. i will order the petite size later on to try  i liked it enough for that. the ""blue"" is a nice teal color. double layer  and extremely comfortable. the finish is laser cut  no stichting."
1,I love this shirt. the colors are just as depicted. the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering. fits true to size for retailer small (i'm normally a medium outside of this store).
-1,I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact  that after the first size didn't fit  i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl  l  m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful  but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
1,Listen up gals - buy every color before they disappear!!! this top is amazing. so flattering  incredible fabric  the colors are divine and the price is amazing! i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever. a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in. i'm curvy - generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh. peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way  or look like a maternity top on me. this one is magic. hits a big longer 
-1,"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching.     i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top."
0,Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big  boxy  and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0
-1,I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered  but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good  but the back just looked like a big oversized  stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall  go for it!!
1,"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit  flattering silhouette  comfortable fabric  shape enhancing cut  and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd"
1,This blouse has a nice casual feel with feminine lines and the swingy design is flattering.
-1,I love the idea of this top  but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back  the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric  i wo
-1,I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money  for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.
0,Although the design and quality were great  this did not work for me. it was boxy  square and overwhelmed my petite frame. if you are taller  or have a longer torso  this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe.
1,I am wearing a medium in the photos  my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference.
1,Great fit and extremely comfortable.
-1,I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.
1,This shirt feels amazing  it is the perfect length for leggings. i have it in long sleeves also. i don't love the pink color i bought  it looks very different from the color pictured.
-1,Darling jacket/coat  similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one  but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that's simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one.
1,I got this dress on sale (under 20 dollars) but i would pay more!  it runs very large - i got a medium which is roomy  irl i wear a large (vanity sizing i suppose!).  the colors are so pretty  it is lined so you don't need a slip or cami.  highly recommend!
0,This is a very light  flowy dress. the lining is very fitted  but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow  but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty.
-1,Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.
0,This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
0,"This dress was so lovely in person  but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3"" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!"
1,The material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive  but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!
0,I bought this mostly to wear around the house  so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.  that said  this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose  and it doesn't really hang well over my hips  which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy  which is nice  but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling  bu
-1,This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and  without a chunky statement necklace  it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.
1,I love this skirt. it does run a little small  i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist  but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids  and they all love it as well.
0,The fabric   feel and design of this dress is sooo cute  but so large that sadly  it will need to go back. beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering.
1,Loved it. i have receive so many compliments when i wear this. it fit great.
0,Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look  so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me  but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.
0,I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful  drab actual color.
1,These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .
1,This is a simple shirt  but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer! i'm ordering one in the blue and white as well... i know this is going to be a fave. i love supima cotton  and though i adore retailer  i do wish they'd carry more of the supima rather than the non-organic fabrics. so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy  because i prefer the feel of silk  linen and cotton. thanks for this one  retailer!
0,"High quality  yummy soft fabric  gorgeous color. even with those three pros  this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2"" and 150 lbs  size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one  however has capri pants  hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall  thin woman  it probably works!"
-1,"Right out of the bag  this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top  though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.  and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose  droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty"""
