1,With my 5'9'  hourglass frame  wider hips and having a baby  i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however  with this  i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts: _________ pros: - lots of stretch and comfort. - pockets! always a plus in my book :) - will go with any top. - nice length. fit me as in the model. - very slimming. - you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi
0,"This is a busy dress that makes me think ""boho-glam holly hobby"". i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me. i'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more. i'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style."
1,This shirt is just precious! i cannot wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring. i'm so in love with it. the detail is just beautiful.
-1,I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width  but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all  it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked  but i decided to keep that one.     the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it  however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
0,This is a truly beautiful dress  and yes  so much better in person.  upon examining the dress  however  i saw some problems.  the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places  there were some frayed ends  and even some &#39;fuzzy&#39; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something.  the dress is over $250  and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch.  returning and hope the replacement is in better shape.  if so  it will be a keeper!
0,This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape  but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
0,I wanted to love these  but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft  however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!
-1,I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time  so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door  however  this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut  but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.
0,Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking
0,Cute pattern  but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!
1,Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent  colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down  worn with a number of various styles - jeans  dress pants  skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit  the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small  but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate
0,This is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it. the fit is great  love the side zippers. i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed. nothing i cant get rid of (till next time i carry a bag!) but if this keeps up there soon won't be much of a shirt left. very disappointing for the price. was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality.
0,"I tried these on in the store  and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5"" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)"
-1,"I'm 5'4"" 120#   34d. this dress did nothing for me. the seem on the side with the knot doesn't look right. it's almost on the side but not really. there's a seem down the center of the butt from the waist. it looks weird from the back because it's such a fine striped print. not flattering at all. the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining. hit me just a bit lower than on the model."
-1,The dress ran big but is tight at the bust  material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.
-1,This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.
0,While i wanted to love this dress  i did not like the scratchy lining. i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably. i wish this had been done in silk  would have been a much nicer material. i returned it.
1,Beautifully designed to flatter a women's figure. i love the fit and feel of this classic  but modern cardigan.
0,Super cute pants but pleats fan out too much when you are pear shaped. i would also need to shorten pants too look like the picture.
0,Cute sweater  i really like the grey color. unfortunately  it was boxy and a little short on me. almost worth keeping  but even with a t-shirt underneath  i wanted to scratch my skin off. it's very itchy. mine is going back.
0,I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt  the top fit a bit odd  not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.
-1,"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so  it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned."
1,Fits perfect!! tank top or bath top. swings nicely and not too tight on top. i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short!
-1,I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
0,Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.
0,These lightweight  wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute  but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide  adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
-1,I was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.
-1,I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small  and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color  and i'm sad that they are so large.
1,On sale this is a great deal. the structure and fit of it are perfect- maybe runs a tad big  but i liked that- it's supposed to be a snug fit  and is  without being too clingy. i chose the berry color and love it- the ribbed style of fabric wasn't as visible in the pic online but i don't mind it in the darker color. can be worn with a bit of flair by unbuttoning the turtleneck or kept classic by not-
1,"This top is ""comfort wear"" or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work. because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer. that said  it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it. i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time  it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable"
1,This dress is very figure flattering.  however  it is not navy it's purple.  overall nice print  somewhat cheap material and zipper gets stuck.  i am keeping because it's versatile and i like the vintage floral pattern.
1,Love the lightweight fabric! looks great with skinny jeans. it is flowy  but flattering.  wearing it on my shoulders for work -
0,This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small.   i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.
0,While the styling is cute  the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.
-1,I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.  problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).  problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
-1,"What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store  which makes sense because if it were hung it up  fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many ""clothes"" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made  so thin with cloth  that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes"
-1,I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress  the silhouette  the flouncy skirt; however  i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy  dark colors.
-1,This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however  it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.
1,If i hadn't seen the description online  i would never have known these pants were navy!   i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic. the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier.  since i'm heavy around the stomach  i will wear the pant with a long tunic top (to avoid the drumstick look) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute. the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid
-1,"I purchased the blue s (140lbs  5'8""  34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however  although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it)  it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but  again  thin and unlined. i think that  even on sale  this is ov"
1,Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also  i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large)  but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows  i would size up. i love the unique design!
-1,I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online. however  i was very disappointed when i finally received it. the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person. i could almost get over the sleeves  but the white part of the shirt was horrible. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer  and i got a small in this top. the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line-- which i
-1,Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed
1,But when i saw this top in person  urged by my stylist when they got it in  i decided to try it on. they had xs in store  my former normal size (xs or xsp). that was too big though. not being sure how the petite would look  and not sure if smaller would work  i decided to order all three: xxs  xsp and xxsp!    verdict on size: xxsp was pulling at the arm holes  kind of small there. xxs regular was almost right  but arm holes were a little high  not as comfortable.  xsp ended up being the right c
-1,Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however  the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.
0,"I don't usually write reviews but this one definitely needs it. i bought this shirt in the wine color in a small. i'm 5'6"" 135lbs and usually wear a small in retailer clothing. loved the color and fit of this shirt  a little longer and loose with unique detailing on the sides. i loved the wine color so much i bought the gray and white stripe one as well. when i bought the gray and white one i had to try on 5-6 smalls before finding one that fit just right. there was a significant difference in the"
-1,"I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered  but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities  for me  ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference i'm 5'4"" and 125  hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me  like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it."
1,"I purchased this dress in my normal small size - via online. i exchanged it it for a medium in the store as the shoulders were just a little too tight for me. i plan on wear it with tights/leggings as it's a little to short on my 5'9"" frame. well made and the bodice has so much detail but not over the top."
1,I saw this dress online this morning  went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest  but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts  and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest  and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!
-1,I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first  it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.
-1,I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
0,"If you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips  the boat-neck on this won't be too wide on you. ---------- i am normally a m or l in retailer tops  and went with the m  and i have very large biceps. if you're broad-shouldered but have smaller arms  i would recommended sizing down a size. ---------- i have a very long torso and didn't find this to be too short...but i love jeans with a 10"" rise. if you are going to pair this with low or medium (8.5"") rise jeans  then yes  you will"
1,Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors. very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this. i wish retailer would have more pieces like this. a+
1,These make your rear look ah-maz-ing!!! i mean  seriously good. every time i wear these  my husband cannot keep his hands off. usually  i'm 27/28  in these i took a 29. perfection. i also got them in the black and blue washes. i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point. so good. awesome price point too.
-1,I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor
1,Although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me! love the material  style  just doesn't look right on me!
1,This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size  i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can't wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don't wait too long before this one sells out.
-1,Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small  and they have a funny smell.
1,In my opinion  the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase. adorable cut and style  comfortable and cute. it's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans. love this!
1,Love! this tank?everyone should own it in every color?it is soft  has a great shape  and is super cute. it goes great with so many of the pants/shorts from retailer as well. summer staple for sure.
0,I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.
-1,"Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison  and i wish all reviewers would include this  i am 5'5"" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it."
0,I like this shirt. it's quite lovely. i ordered it in mint. it's nice to have a dressy t-shirt.
0,This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however  the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.
1,This dress is perfect for any occasion  it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on.
0,I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
-1,"I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6  but could tell that even if i had the 4  the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice  with a fitted slip design."
1,"Just received and sorry to return. i am 5'9"" i wear a size 8 i ordered the m/l . it way really big and to wide"
0,I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall  but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely  especially on the models in the pictures  but didn't quite work out for me. also  it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!
0,The colors of this top are perfect for spring  i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning  is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this  as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.
1,"I love ag for their soft  stretchy denim and flattering fit. bought these today and couldn't be happier! i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size  but the ""regular"" capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle."
1,Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!
