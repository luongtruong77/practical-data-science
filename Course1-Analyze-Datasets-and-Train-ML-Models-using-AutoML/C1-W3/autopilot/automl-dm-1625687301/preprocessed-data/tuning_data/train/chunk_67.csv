1,"Absolutely in love with this dress! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout. i'm a 34b  27"" waist  and 36"" hip and 5'3"" and went with the xsp. very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price."
1,Girls  this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup  there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down  so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas  i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
1,"As others mentioned  the arm holes are a bit large- but i didn't find this too much of a problem. possibly that's because as a smaller chested woman i run into that issue regularly. i'm 5' 4"" 130 and the size 8 fit perfectly. the length is at the top of knee."
-1,When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.
-1,It's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me.
0,"I ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large. i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist  but even so it was still quite loose. the fabric is very stretchy and thin  and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model. for reference  i am 5'-7"" 155lbs  usually wear a medium/8 in a top. this medium was too large."
0,I loved this dress  i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great  loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
-1,Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.
0,Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!
1,"I am going to review this pretty much the way the person ahead of me reviewed it. first  the colors are way more vibrant in person than in the photo. there is even a lavender (which you can sort of see under the yellow stripe). it really makes it look different. second  it is monstrously huge. i am 5'3""  110 pounds and i ordered the xs and it completely swallowed me up. because of the vibrancy of the colors  it didn't blend well with my fair complexion and also  it is like a heavy sweater  not a"
0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt
1,I love this kimono! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame. you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement!
-1,Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes  sadly i sent it back.
0,I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric  but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.
0,This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said  this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.
0,Good structure and quality; a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter! (i ordered the white tee.)
-1,Just a ginormous  shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
1,This shirt spoke to me  as soon as i entered the store! i love the colorful plaid  the flattering cut  and the light  airy material. at very least  i think this will be a three-season go to!
-1,The pants are pretty and run true to size  but the fabric is bathing suit like  very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.
0,"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay"
0,I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute  but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.
-1,I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box  but when i started to unbutton it to try it on  two buttons split in half! it's going right back.
0,I must be one of the rare people that this dress did not work for.  i adored it online and even on the hanger.  putting it on  it just looked frumpy on me (i tried my usual small first).  decided i must need a smaller size  so i sized down to an xs.  this one looked much better on  but was nearly impossible to get in and out of  the built in slip got twisted and i had to start over twice).  i decided i wasn't willing to work up a sweat getting dressed and undressed when i wore it.  i passed.
1,"I love this dress! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim. it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6  but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses. i am 5' 8""  small busted  and a ""pear"" shape  so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt. i love the length hitting just below the knee. it is flattering for my body type. seems well made and at a good price point."
-1,"The photos don't look it  but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.     disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!"
1,This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.
0,I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit  the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are  so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this)  the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
-1,The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning.
-1,I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design  but the sleeves made this a quick return ....
0,Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.
-1,First of all  this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.  second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.  not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning  but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!
-1,"I am 5'3"" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall  it just doesn't work. also  i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh."
1,"These jeans are extremely soft to the rich  as well as stretchy and flattering. they do not lose their shape after a whole day of wear. i am 5'3"" and the ankle length fits me as full length. i am a big fan."
1,"It actually is a pretty good t-shirt  but i wish that i had known that ""white"" actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige. i bought three and will now need to return them all. hopefully i can find it in other colors i like."
0,I purchased this on sale  xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater  but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy  but i would say itchy and cozy!
-1,I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also  this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.
-1,What a beautiful  comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent  even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2  105lbs  and ordered the xxs petite.
-1,I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.
0,For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier  more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.
-1,This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body  maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately  i had to return it.
1,Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it. i tried it on and fell madly in love! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world. it is soft and cozy. comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam. its almost sold out already  so grab it if you can cuz its divine! does run a little big  so i got a 0 instead of a 2 and its perfect.
1,"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side."
0,"I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab  yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2"" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons  yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands  yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits  so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits"
1,"This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love  love  love this dress!!"
0,"The shorts are very cute  very nice quality and intricate detailing! the sizing is tight in waist and very big in legs not flattering at all. i'm 5'1""  115 lbs. they are going back."
1,Omg i am absolutely in love with this dress  i saw it on line and knew immediately that i had to have it! i decided to go into the store to try it and it looks even better on than it did on the website. the a-line shape is very flattering and the retro pattern and colors are amazing! the only down side if there even is on is that it is a little tight across the chest but i am a 36ddd so sometimes that happens  i just took a large rather than my usual medium. other than that  this dress is my fav
1,Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.
-1,I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference  i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.
0,This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue)  but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).
-1,This shirt is unflattering and boxy. it does not look cute at all on me. i am returning.
0,The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.
1,I purchased this shirt in blue and i like it. the fabric is more of a stretchy/jersey material - didn't expect that. but the shirt looks decent on and is comfortable.
-1,I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears  the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.
0,I ordered this dress and have sent it back. i think it could be a flattering dress; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly. i am very long waisted  so this might just be a problem for me. i ordered regular size 2.
-1,The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but  it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.
1,I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband  but i love them. they feel wonderful  yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night.
1,Great skirt  can be dressy  work or casual  love it!
0,"The double seams down the front of this elongate; the material is light and would work spring through summer  kind shape. even though the dress hits below the knee  the buttons end mid thigh and make it cute rather than matronly. here's the but:  the rib cage area is very fitted. i'm a 6-8  in pretty good shape  and that is not a ""problem area"" for me. however  in this dress  it was. there was no way for my figure to pull it off. from behind  in both 6 and 8  every bundle of skin seemed ample. i"
0,I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.
0,Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.
1,Get this one during the 20% sale. if you dry clean it  you will have it forever!
-1,I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful  plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest  away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.
-1,This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric  especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however  the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition  the bow seemed to be too t
-1,This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
1,I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.
-1,"Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!"
1,"When this appeared on line  i thought t would be a sure thing  color (blue)  cut and style  this dress appeared to have been made for me  but i ultimately i ended up returning it for several reasons. fit: i was worried about the length on my 5'5"" frame but it was actually long enough. i have narrow shoulders and average arms but i found the shoulders or maybe it was the upper arms to run slightly small in my regular size which caused some strange poofing at the shoulders. not sure if going up a"
1,This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.
1,The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter  but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!
0,I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress  but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality  a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
0,This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately  it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes  ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.
