-1,I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.  the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived  new in the packages  with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin  as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area
-1,This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.
0,I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful  both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees  not like shown in the picture here. on that note  i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
-1,This is a cute dress  but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small  2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame  this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller  thinner people. unfortunately  mine is going back.
0,"When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4"") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very"
0,The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized   therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders   the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .
0,This shirt had everything going for it - the cut  the length  the fun texture  but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through. i don't want to have to wear another shirt underneath. this one is going back. definitely not a swing  but still cute.
1,Great fit  very soft fabric  and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.
-1,This dress really was huge  and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft  but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this  no matter what your body shape is.
1,I initially ordered a small  but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like  even considering the style. (i was swimming in fabric!) i exchanged it for a petite small  and it fit perfectly. it goes so well with so many looks  and it is going to last a long while in my rotation. looks much better in person  too. my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received  this one had many threads loose throughout  which i clipped and think will be alright  but i expected
1,So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year  i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom
0,The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price  i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.
1,This dress is super comfy and really cute! i was worried that the horizontal stripes might not be flattering  but they didn't make me look larger at all. it's great for casual wear  but can easily be dressed up with a jacket and booties.
1,The colors and textures on this top are fun. however  the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise.
-1,This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however  the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
0,Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist  this won't fit well. too bad  because it's super cute  if a bit sheer.
1,"Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however  the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3""   118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer  and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace."
0,But  saldly  no....i tried the multicolored version in a size m and l. the fabric is almost good  though a touch sheer and perhaps problematic for washing. the real issue  though  is the fit. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist i typically wear a m in a knit top  but the waistband was tight and not forgiving. i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist. when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be (longer) it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my
0,This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty  this is great  but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy  but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra  which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly  so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy  which i liked very muc
-1,The quality of the shirt is top notch. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable.  now the cons:  this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me.
-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well. possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.
0,"Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6""  130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame"
1,I love these jeans! i really like the way they fit and haven't had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have.
-1,I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite  it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.
1,I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!
0,I really wanted to love this top. love the mix of fabrics and patterns. but it is too short for a tunic length. i should have paid attention to other reviews. i'm about 5'8'' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length isn't right.
-1,I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall. i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine  whimsical top so i ordered a small online. but even then a small is still too big (and i usually wear a medium or an 8 in tops). maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs/waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity-ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust. the front was too short  as well (stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i'm assuming sh
-1,Similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
0,As other reviewers have noted  the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans  but otherwise is unflattering.  also  the color is described as black  but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult  but if able to  i would have returned it.
-1,I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12  hourglass)  these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds  just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.
-1,I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted  it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic  or less voluminous  it could have worked but nope.
1,I agree with the other reviews! perfect color and weight to the dress. should wear well in summer and fall. i'm 5'5'' 34c 140lbs athletic and got the 6 regular. fit well and the length was perfect with flats.
1,After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors  i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin  so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!
1,From unique shape to feminine design  this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago.  it's also flattering  especially for this petite  who doesn't like to show her upper arms.
0,I wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didn't fit to me unfortunately... but the design was pretty!
-1,This dress has beautiful lines. i loved the design on the material  but the fabric looked very cheap & even was already snagged when it arrived. unfortunately  i must return it.
1,"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black  and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it  but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer  so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it  which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine  but now i will be looking for i"
-1,This shirt runs very large. i will be returning for a smaller size.
1,These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy. they're the perfect summer pants.
1,This is a gorgeous piece of clothing - true to size  simple yet flattering lines  very comfortable. it has such flattering little touches as well  such as the detail work on the sleeves. love it  love it  love it! i just wish it were machine washable!!
0,Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.
0,Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.
0,"I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however  the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5""  125#  34c)  but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally  the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l"
1,"This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5""1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!"
-1,This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin  and this style of top is usually quite flattering  but this one missed the mark big time.
0,"I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however  when i put the dress on  there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4"" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top."
0,I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty  but as has been said  i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail  the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return  and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy  but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath  as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day
-1,This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful  vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.
0,I love maeve tops. i love the material and feel of this brand. when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on. i'm usually a large in a top  once in a while an xl. they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motif. i could barely get the top on. it looked like i was missing 1/2 of the top. i doubled checked the size and it was a large. it's a shame  the top is really cute. if you are the least bit broad or busty  go up a size or two. if you are usually a
0,Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty  curvy lady this one just didn't sit right  ran a tad large  and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame  may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.
0,I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.
0,Dang  i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish  a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.
-1,"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4""  120 lb  32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust  but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips  making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice  but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy."
-1,Really like this dress but.....  the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress  worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.  impossible!  has to go back
-1,Love the look of this and the fabric  but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0  then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.
1,It is a little boxy  but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft  the ruffles keep their shape and position  and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides  they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot  a little below the hip. 5?1??  100 lbs  and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
1,This general sweatshirt is cute  stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings.
0,This sweater is beautiful and well made  but i found the cut strange and unflattering. i ordered it in my usual size small  and it was too big in the shoulders and arms  with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms. but it just fit me in the chest  and would be too tight if i sized down. this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual.
1,Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
-1,"There were no reviews  it's an ""online exclusive"" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this  it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth"
0,I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot  especially the front macrame part  but for me it did not work at all. also  too expensive for a tee.
1,I have these in 3 colors and i always wear a 27 in pilcro. i could probably size down but i like them a little loose. they are great to have in the spring and summer. they are very soft and very comfy.
0,Is a great top for layering over leggings  running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn't look great on me and for the price  i just didn't love it.
-1,Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.
-1,"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material  although comfortable  is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these  the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore  these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white  at that)  so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature"
-1,I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
1,I ordered:  xsp  xxs  xxsp    xxsp was the better fit  some people loved it some didn't like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said  ti was comfortable  the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders  and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m
1,"I bought this top in lavender. this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size. i'm 5'4""  34dd  150 lbs- m fits well. it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot. it's a very easy to put on and take to it off."
1,"I was on the fence about this dress - i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation. i'm glad i took the chance once it went on sale! the fabric is not as thick as you'd expect for a ""sweater."" just thick enough to hide any imperfections  panty lines  etc. i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket. i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneck.    i'm 5'6'  135 lbs  34b and the small fit perfectly. i am ""pear - shaped"" by conventional standards  bu"
-1,I don't know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height (5'5''  athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting  it's so soft!
1,The label says 100% linen  but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit  but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it.     i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape  but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much  i just bought another one in mauve.
