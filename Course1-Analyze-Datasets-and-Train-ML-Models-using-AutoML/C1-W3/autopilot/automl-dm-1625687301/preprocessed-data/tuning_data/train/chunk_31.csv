1,The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though  because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall  very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)
0,"Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed. it was reticketed and it didn't really feel ""brand new"" when it arrived"
1,I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.
-1,Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus  it's cream  not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.
1,I think this may almost make it back to the more classic pieces retailer used to have. i tried on the xs in store so i ordered the xxs and xs petite... i felt the usual xs was a little big (again  i think retailer is making things bigger...) my verdict is iliked the length on the regular size better and the xxs fit well. but not much difference (the xs petite was a similar size be the arm hole was higher).  colors are very neutral and warm. i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh
-1,"This tunic only barely resembles the photo in person.  first  the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos  second  it's huge. i'm 5'4"" and typically wear 2 or 4p in retailerpolgies' shirts/dresses. i ordered the sp and the dress was at least 1.5 times wider than it needed to be. it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless; and the style doesn't really lend itself to use with a belt."
0,This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.
1,Just beautiful dress! it dits perfectly  tts and i feel like princess in it! highly recommend girls!
0,These are so cute and the colors are great  however  they stretch out about 2 sizes. they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big. i'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way. didn't think they would stretch out as much as they did. and they look awful once  they've stretched out. wish i didn't take the tags off or i would have returned them. size down at  least one size  i could have sized down two sizes. hoping they shrink lik
0,This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.
-1,Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.
-1,As a tall girl  i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however  as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony  the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!
-1,The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big. that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering. quality was excellent. denim was thick with the right amount of stretch. unfortunately they had to go back.
-1,I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.
-1,I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still  i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house  doing chores  resting  etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but  around home  it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.
0,This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering  it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.
1,I purchased this dress on a whim. it is easy to wear and very comfortable.  the empire waist is flattering. however  the dress runs large and the lower half is a-line. the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dress.  i am happy to have it in my wardrobe. a go-to piece for years to come.
0,The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .
-1,The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin  kind of scratchy & has  almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as  movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!
-1,The dress has a partially sewn-in slip  which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.    i ordered a medium  and if it hadn't been for the slip  the fit would have been good. the length was as pictured. for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd.
0,Did not notice small hole and stain on the bottoms until i had the tags removed the return label shredded.
-1,This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs  ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering  and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed  and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi
-1,"I agree with other reviewers. it is beautiful but too tight around the chest. i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest. i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable. sadly i had to return it. i am 5'4""  134 lbs and a 34c  by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual."
1,This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric  detailed embroidery  and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy  yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.
0,This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material  maybe washing them would help  but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.
1,A beautiful classic!  love the denim fabric in such a pretty style.  this top has a more flattering fit than appears in the pics.  the fabric is soft and the fit very flattering.  ordered my usual size medium and fits perfectly........very true to size.
1,I bought a size xl in the white with brighter small florals. i paid full-price as a splurge for summer. the details on the top are just as nice in person as shown in the photos. it's a sweet top. i love the upper portion. however  it runs long. i need to belt it/tuck it or it looks strangely like a long-tunic. the floral material is slippery and a little heavy. not the softest but it's washed well. i love the mix of laces at the top. it's pretty. not worth full-price but on sale  it's worth tryi
1,A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on. i had never tried the hoxton before. i have found my perfect black jean! they are so comfortable and they don't stretch out like others i have tried.  i am 5'4 and i roll them a few times but i like that look. i am usually a 25 and that is what i took in these.
-1,This dress is so pretty  a true cinderella dress  that's why i can't find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic. i don't understand much about fabrics  but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent. i bought a size 14  which is what i wear in moulinette souers (i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand)  the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering. i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
1,I tried this shirt and really loved the feel  and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery  and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me  but i'm between m&l  and sized down  so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!
0,I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious  wonderful for fall or winter  and the gold  gray  and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus  pockets! however  the midi length did not work for me  despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length  just above the knee. i'm not
-1,I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric  it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
0,These are very well constructed  medium weight  besutiful leggings.
0,I wanted to love this but if you carry your weight in your hips  butt or thighs this is not the dress for you. runs tts. i'm 5'5  135 lb and the small fit but made my lower half look even wider than what it it. also felt like it was a bit too long in length.
1,I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.
0,I liked the look of the tunic sweater  and it was very soft. i am 5'7  115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight  but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings  and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft  but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.
0,I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.
0,This dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night. it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my. it's a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for.
-1,This dress is beautiful and extremely well made... if you can get into it. the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back. it's form fitting  so you'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand. i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper  but it's soooo form fitting i'm afraid i wouldn't wear it.
0,I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy
1,These leggings are so warm and comfortable. they're thick enough to wear as pants  and they don't stretch and slide during the day. i wish they came in more colors!
0,Nice cut but 6 inches too long and no petite sizes available.
0,I'm a 14 bottom and a 10/12 on top  so i'm curvy  which makes one-piece swimsuits hard to shop for. i ordered a m & l  and while the m overall fit me better  the cup size was still way too big on me. i'm a 34d  and i need another set of my 'girls' to fit into the cups. otherwise this swimsuit is so beautiful!
-1,"I bought these last year and loved them  however they came in tall sizes. this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short  even at 33"". im 5'7"" and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg. i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal"
0,The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!
0,I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
1,"These are really cute pants. nice flowy fabric - perfect for dressing up or down from spring to fall. the only problem for me was the sizing. i tried my usual xs/0  (5'7""  115lbs) but they were huge - as in  pulled them on without realizing there was actually a zipper opening! i then decided to try the petitie in the xs and those fit perfectly but unfortunately they were too short. the regular length were too long and would have needed hemming but that would not have bothered me as it would have"
1,This dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding. you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra. i am sending it back because as it runs very small. i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top.
1,I love this top and bought it in both colors. what's really fun is that i found a pair of espadrille sandals to match the sandy beige and white colored top and i have attached a photo of me under my arbor to show you. these tops are designed to have a flattering fit. i ordered size small and they are not too tight. i am 36 c in the bust line and an hour glass figure on bottom. i love that they are off the shoulder a bit and in a v neck  which is flattering on me. the material is soft and of good
1,I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder  loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.
-1,I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall  in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow  the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed  the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build  and  frankly  i usually look good in sweaters
0,This is such a cute top with so much potential  soft fabric  vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top  regrettably  has to go back.  i love swing tops but retailer  could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??
-1,This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life  not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
1,This shirt is versatile for work and fun. my sister has this shirt and thought it was so cute  i ordered it too.
1,You have to try it on to see  it fits really well and looks stylish. i love it.  my only concern is the fabric is rather stretchy  not sure if it will hold up well in the long run.
0,I love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment. i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large. the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly  the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldn't sit right. overall the fit was boxy and unflattering. the fabric is pretty but the style is well....boring. there was just no wow factor for me. i think the fabric deserved a much better design. imho i think this top might be better suited fo
-1,I had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3  105lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.
0,Pretty top  i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.
0,On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick  stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also  the color is a dark  brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.
-1,I loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly. it makes me look like a football player! i am 5'8 135/athletic build and i was swimming in the m. i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads. it hangs and gaps awkwardly. the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short.
-1,I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.
-1,"I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous  very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and  it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2""  112lbs...with a small frame."
1,The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like. the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color. it looks great on and the colors compliment each other. i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe.
1,These got me so excited for fall. the teal is a color i'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these. when they arrived though  i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch. the fit is snug  but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable! these will be a staple in my wardrobe. i want to order more colors!
0,The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.
1,"This is a cute sweater  i agree that it's slightly boxy partly because of the side pockets which i think are cute. the yellow is darker than it appears on my screen  more like a mustardy-gold which is not great on my skin tone. i think it's true to size  i got my usual retailer size: xspetite (i'm 34aa  26"" waist) and it fits just right. it's soft and a nice medium weight. on the packaging it was called a bomber  so i'd say it is cut a little like a bomber jacket."
-1,"I wanted this skirt to work! it is soft  comfortable  and cute! unfortunately  it runs to short.  i am 5'8"" and would not be able to pull it off at work. i ordered a bigger size and it still didn't work."
-1,Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!
1,"This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric  i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4""  about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee  which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all  i can see mys"
1,Love these vintage soft jeans.. they do run small so be sure get a size larger.. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28... look amazing with boots  flip flops and slip ons... love mother jeans.. work every time
1,I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.
