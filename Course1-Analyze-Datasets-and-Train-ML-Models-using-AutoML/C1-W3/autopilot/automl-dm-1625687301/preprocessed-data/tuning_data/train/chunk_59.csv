1,This dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich  luxurious fabric  a deep neckline  and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and  while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers  for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!
1,Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist doesn't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops
1,Retailer has done it again! i love this top. i purchased it for our engagement photos. i am typically a small or medium  and decided to size down for this one. i purchased a small and it fit perfectly! its not near as long as it is in the photo  which pleased me. i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit - and i can definitely see how that would be an issue.
-1,Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s
-1,I purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved it's nautical theme pattern.  when i recurve do the dress  i found it to be stiff and boxy.  being a petite  short-waisted person  the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly.  my bra strap was showing in the back  and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame.    i returned the dress
-1,"Love tiny. i am 5'7""  125-128 lbs depending on the day  and a 34a. i also have a very long torso  and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one  however  was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated  so it looked boxy on me. however  the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo  and then"
1,Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight  it's back  and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made  can go from business to sport to casual.
1,"My husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on. oohs and aaaahs galore with this one! let's let him review this one....he says he loves the vibrant color  length  and the way the top is perfectly fitted. he was impressed with the lining and the ""mesh"" at the hem that keeps the 'flare' in the skirt (i had to explain that one)! he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees"
1,Comfy  but constantly picking pills off of it  from first wear.
0,The wine color is beautiful  and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however  both fabrics are thin  and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so  if you are the quintessential tall and thin  and you don't mind showing your bra  go for it! otherwise  i suggest skipping this one.
1,I'm so sad this doesn't come in a petite length because the dress is extremely long! the fabric and design is beautiful although i do wish the fabric was a bit more flowly.
1,"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else."
1,This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9  a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!
1,Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
0,"I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9""  32c and i wear 28 size pants  usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp"
-1,I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well  and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down  but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.
-1,The dress is beautiful in pictures  but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly  had to return.
-1,On me  this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9  34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly  for the price and fit  i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.
-1,This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.
-1,"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5""  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st"
0,Pretty tee  but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful  but fit is blah.
-1,I loved this dress before putting it on  but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
-1,This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
0,I'm tall and small chested so the dress didn't fit me perfectly. i adore the color and pattern  but wish it was less revealing in the chest area. i definitely have to wear something under. otherwise high quality and unique dress!
0,Very nice top  like the linen fabric. i ordered my regular size m and its huge. makes me look larger than i am  and i will be returning it. i would like a size s i think  just not a flattering oversize fit for me
0,The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.
-1,I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
-1,I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.
-1,I am a 32dd  5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.
1,Beautiful dress  but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist. it runs huge: i'm 5'6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best. there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist. i received a lot of compliments on this dress! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes.
0,I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed  and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water  the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad  luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned  these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena
0,I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great  so soft & comfy  but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me  it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top  but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model  this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty.
-1,I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!
1,This dress is beautiful  i usually wear a 6 or 8 and i ordered a 4  it is huge  i will be returning.
1,I purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered. all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry. the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable. the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build. i felt these were in general true to size. no doubt i will wear these all winter! thanks antro!!
1,"I usually wear a 4 in maeve  and purchased this is a 6 in the orange. i'm just over 5'7""  34c  size 26/27 jeans. through the bust and arms the 6 fits great. i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable. it hangs well  though  if not a bit loose. definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person. i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist  the length wouldn't be an issue. and it isn't even that much of an issue  but i did knock off a star for that reason. i bo"
1,This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through  but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.
1,Love this top (and every top tiny puts out).  runs very small.  i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top.  so pretty and great detail
-1,The shirt is cute  but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.
0,Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit  more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
0,I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink  but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large  hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle  but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.
1,The sweater is as cute in person as it is online.
0,Ahhh  i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed  this top runs very large. style wise  it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.
-1,This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
-1,The quality of the fabric is good  but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass.
0,It's a t-shirt. a very cute print  nice cut  very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore  why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it  but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.    for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer  and the medium fit well.
0,I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.
1,This duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight. i'm not sure it's worth this price point but it's not cheaply made  either. the colors are as shown on the website to a 't'. the length is also as shown. i am 5'5 142 lbs and 34d and the small is perfect. i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect. colors are dark teal  salmon and gold. this is a three seaso
1,The lengths is what drew me to this top. i love the simple look of the cowl neck. nice detail to the sleeve that creates a more than casual look.
1,"I really like the appearance of this item  and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a ""true to size"" small  and this hangs on me a little  but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!"
0,So many things to love: love the mod kind of style  the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model  i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it  but the waist is already so high  i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.
0,The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece  either way  i'll be sending it in for return.
-1,I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!
0,Relaxed fit  soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price  i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...
0,These pants are so adorable and fit perfectly (long enough even on my 5'10 frame) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through  even with nude panties. you can still clearly see them. so disappointed.
0,Should have ordered the xl instead of the large. didn't even come close to being able to button the front but i'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small. beautiful soft green color  fabric is soft too. it is cropped to the waist. decided to return instead of reorder.
1,After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs  so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace
1,I was pleasantly surprised with this one. fits a bit large. i'm 8-10  the 8 fits just right. the moss is a great staple color.
-1,So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money  but i needed something to wear that was transitional.
0,This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip
-1,I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l  this would have looked like a maternity top on me.
1,This is soft to the touch and just beautiful.  it is a little roomy  but true to size. i love it that way.   totally on trend for the season
0,I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however  while i liked the irregular hemline on the model  on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern  definitely no dryer on this one.
0,"Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom"
0,First  i absolutely love this dress  and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended  and the dress fits perfectly. however  when i zipped the dress up  the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly  so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.
-1,Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
1,I was on the fence about this top  because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however  it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans  wedge sandals  and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.
0,This is a lovely skirt that fits well  but it is much more of a yellowy cream color than white. also  it felt very static-y.
0,I was very pleasantly surprised by the beautiful  intricate threaded material of this shirt! it takes the shirt from a casual top to an intricate and unique piece in my closet that can be dressed up or down. the top is definitely larger than i expected - i wear a size small (ordered a small) and it's very wide (lots of extra material) as it falls! i checked it to see if i had accidentally received a large when it first came. it looks like a baby doll shirt  with the shirt getting wider and more
-1,The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.
-1,"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back."
