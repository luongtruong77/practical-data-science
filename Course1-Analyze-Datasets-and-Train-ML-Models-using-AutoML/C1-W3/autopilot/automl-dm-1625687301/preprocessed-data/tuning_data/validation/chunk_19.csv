-1,"I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled  but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny  and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny  not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again  maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3"" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle"
0,I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived  it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.  i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.  this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down)  but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.  i'd only recomme
1,Adorable dress  amazing fit!
-1,I too will be returning this sweater. love the style  shape and fabric  but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.
-1,This should have been cute  but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering.
1,Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small   and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.
0,I really wanted to love this dress  but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless  but it didn't work for this short 
0,As the other reviewer said  this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer  and i am short... i tried on xxs regular  xs petite and xs regular.    xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders  cehst)  but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular  a bit longer  but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this  but probably something beter wil lcome along.    great for those who want to show their assets
-1,Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size  but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought  better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well  literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
1,The details and colors are exquisite. stop hesitating and get this dress
-1,I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine  but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck  it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup  and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and  for this reason  would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate  because the design is so pretty.
0,The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.
1,This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!
0,I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric  no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms  might work for you. sending it back.
-1,"I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore  and 2) are ""curvy on the bottom"" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans  and like the other reviewer observed as well  i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that  but they just are"
-1,This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color  but frankly  that's about it.
1,Great print and material  but this top runs large. i'm 36c and usually wear l in most lines retailer carries  but this was just big. i reordered in a medium.
1,Wonderful and comfortable dress  very sweet.
0,I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy  yet unshapely. after the initial wear  the product begins to stretch out  and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft  but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely  but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a
0,Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it.
0,"It gets a little old to receive products over and over that do not match the photo or description of the product  retailer! the photo shows a black pant with blue colored striping. the pants that i got are black with green and brown striping. i find the color combination in the photo to be what i wanted and since the fit was nice (albeit short and i'm only 5'5"" tall) i would have kept these. unfortunately  the pants that i got are nowhere close to the description so i will be returning them. the f"
-1,I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
1,I worry when i have an elastic waist  or something that resembles this  but the dress hangs like a dream. no puffing out  no gathers that you can see. it is not sheath  but not a line either  kind of in between  hits several inches above my knees  but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey  have to try it on agin in daylight  but i would say think black on the top  light camel color on the bottom i am 5'8  typically wear a size 12  and it was true to size for me the
1,This top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size. love the back detailing. and it is really good t-shirt quality.
-1,As other reviews have mentioned  this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly  returned asap.
1,Easy to wear  get lots of compliments when i wear it. can be dressed up or down
0,Like others reviewers mentioned on here  this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me  as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame  but for tall  busty  and curvier girls  it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.  however  i'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel
-1,I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice  but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly  the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and  thus  could not even put the shirt on. needless to say  i will be returning it. i ordered the xs  so it is possible that larger sizes do n
-1,I was so excited to order this dress  had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.
1,When i walked into the store  this tee instantly caught my eye. it's light weight  not too low cut and longer in the back. great with jeans  skirts or shorts.
0,This sweater dress was incredibly soft  and i loved the button detail down the back. unfortunately  i'm an hourglass figure (32dd with 26'' waist). this sweater did nothing to flatter me. i tried it in 2 different sizes; the ps looked far too big on  but the pxs created an awkward baggy area in my midsection while fitting nicely elsewhere. the petite length was great - i am 5'1 and i would not have wanted it any shorter. wish this was a little more tapered in the waist  because the quality is lo
-1,Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash.
1,I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu
0,Looks so beautiful.... on a hanger. does not really do anything on a person. beautiful beading but the dress on is very sack-like. i will be returning it
0,This vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful  but the fit is very off. you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs  and made my waist look wide. it also ran small.
1,Ordered this in my typical size  xs  and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis  but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus  there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral  brown that should go with almost anything.
-1,I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no  retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
-1,Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn't get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best  tight in the hips  extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can't see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric  skip.
1,This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.
1,Soft fabric  waistband is flat no vpl!lace trim cuts in a bit for a little vpl- but still nice lightweight  barely there but full coverage. would buy again!
1,Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.
-1,Boxy  short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...
-1,Pretty shirt on the hanger  but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self  there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo  now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept  but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering  and i'm just a 34 b.
0,The green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho.
-1,This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7)  it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.
-1,Nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized. material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person.
0,"This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however  i'm 5' 5"" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing  but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad  i love the top 90% of it."
1,I do not know where to begin....this sweater exceeds my expectation! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper....as beautiful as that one is...this one made my mouth fall open. it is unlike anything i have. it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways. not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big!
0,This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.
0,I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal
1,I wasn't sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist didn't fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these  either. i have slim legs- if you don't  i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
-1,I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy. it did not look flattering and will be going back.
0,Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(
-1,This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably  i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
-1,I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
0,The outer layer runs large up top; also  the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.
1,Great fit  perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!
-1,This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape. it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy. too bad!
0,I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now  so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful  but there is no lining  leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d
1,This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this
-1,"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb  5'-4""  36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern  color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent  lol. also  the back is slightly longer than the front  something i couldnt see from the pictures online."
1,To my surprise this sweater is heavy  chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.
0,Wanted to love this top  but couldn't. the arm holes where so big you have to wear a top under to hide side boob... very light sheer material. had to go back
0,"This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect  falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5"" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly  which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip  to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra"
1,"Absolutely love this little shift!!! i bought it on a whim really. it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80's! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar :-) this is not that sort of velvet. it's also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet. i always find those to have a somewhat ""plastic"" sheen to them. that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur"
1,This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale  but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online  i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit  but the seam on the s fit a bit higher  which was more flattering on me  so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down
0,I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6  137lbs  34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it  regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!
0,This dress fit perfectly  i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.   a must have on sale or clearance  but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination  we will see t
1,"I'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down. for reference  i am 5'7"" and generally a size 8 or m in dresses. the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way  but a medium would have swallowed me. otherwise  it's a great  casual piece. the material is light and soft  and it's cute over leggings."
-1,I really wanted to like this top  but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person. the yellow looks dirty in real life  not pretty like the picture. it is also a strange fit/shape when it is on. i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all.
1,"I think the fabric is very nice and soft. i find this top runs very large. i am 5'2"" 130l. normally wear a small in a shirt. i should have ordered xs it is very large. i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size. the shoulder area fits fine. i may try tucking it in. other than size a nice top."
