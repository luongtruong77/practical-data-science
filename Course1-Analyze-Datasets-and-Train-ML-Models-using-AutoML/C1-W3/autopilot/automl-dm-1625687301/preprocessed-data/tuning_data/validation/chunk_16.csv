-1,This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap  rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.
-1,"In paper crown dresses  i wear a small or size 6  so for this top  i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference  i'm 5'7""  130 lbs  34a. it is very wide towards the bottom  and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff  so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs  i think the bottom would still look unflattering  so i'm returning this."
0,"I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event  i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10"") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit"
-1,I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me. sadly  this dress is a definite exception  which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress. as other reviewers stated  the dress does run small  but even if you size up  if you have any breasts at all  the dress will pull at the buttons  causing them to gape (i'm only a b cup  so not on the large side.) i'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture. i love
0,Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.
0,Bought this in the white. i found it to run narrow in the shoulders and tight in the biceps. i typically vacillate between a m and l  and because of the two aforementioned factors i went with the large  which means overall the shirt is very billowy on me in the chest area and hangs very long. ---------- the fabric is soft  and the weight of this shirt is season-less; always a plus. it is not sheer by any means  but if you have a tattoo (like i do) you will be able to see it. --------- quality is
0,This suit itself is adorable. i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big. it says light padding but there is no padding. just a giant empty cup. i'm going to order the size medium.
1,I have several lilka pj bottoms and i'm glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection! tts  soft flannel  striking colors  only wish they had pockets!
-1,Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
1,I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red for it doesn't compare to the black one.i would have loved it if it was a red dress with white flowers.i didn't like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!
1,I completely disagree with the previous review. i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it! i went out for a couple occasions (one being special and the other not so special) and both times i received compliments all night! my husband loves it and that really says a lot. i feel the dress runs true to size  and the quality is right where it should be... runway worthy... absolutely!.... worth $3000's + ?....probably not  but i personally can't afford that anyway. i'm so happy to have found th
0,It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. i have several maeve dresses which i love so i thought this would be a sure thing. i was really excited when it arrived because when i opened the package the dress looked just as beautiful...until i put it on. fit is fine from the waist down but the upper part fits very poorly especially in the back. not sure if it's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice doesn't lie flat
1,I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute  comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying  it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!
1,This shirt is really cute.  i love the color and design.  i like wearing it with jeans and sneakers.
-1,I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size  they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable)  but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th
0,Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person  the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped  the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...
1,The sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so i'm keeping it. it seems well made so i'm not expecting easy snags  it washed well.
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
0,I like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem isn't flattering on my figure. i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite.
-1,Love this top! it's pretty  unique and well made. i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look.
-1,I wanted to love this  but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.     love most retailer styles  but this one was a miss and a return.
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.
1,These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made  and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate  and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!
-1,Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
1,Yes  this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on  oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d
0,I'm not in love with this  but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isn't bad so i'm keeping it. i got it in s  and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops (34b  26 inch waist  120lbs). if i had gone with xs it probably would've been too tight in the shoulders. however i could be 6 months pregnant and you wouldn't know it. it is very boxy in the torso  and i realize the design is for it to be flowy  as the back is partially split. but it looks relatively fitted on the model  which is
-1,Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.
-1,I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs  but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.
0,"I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however  it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3"" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price."
-1,I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite   and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit  it was very long  even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side  the blue was a very nice  cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice  just too much fabric for me. returning!
-1,... for the model to look like this? pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version  at least  are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown  not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip. cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin
1,This is theoretically a great summer top addition to your wardrobe. i love the floral print - it's bold and lively primary colors on a black background. i'm usually a size small in retailer tops and neither the small nor the medium fit me very well. the small was a bit too fitted everywhere and strangely  the medium gapes at the front when i'm sitting but not standing (i'm 34b otherwise height-weight proportionate with broad shoulders). another reviewer mentioned a design flaw - the floral print i
1,I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!
1,I love the way this fits and feels on. it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear. i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well. the only con is that it is dry clean only.
0,I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve  but the sleeves do not fit loosely  they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms  so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves  but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking  but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
-1,Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.
-1,I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did  i was very excited  in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately  neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows  making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
-1,Definitely agree with the other reviewers. this top looks great on the model  but pretty bad in real life. super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs. if you plan on ordering  i'd recommend sizing down.
1,"We were at dinner in provence at sunset... and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender? dusty blue? lilac? creation- just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable  yet lacy enough to be elegant. the color struck me as ""south-of-france"". they were american by accent. i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress  but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine. magnolia lace dress- i found you!!!"
1,Very true to size. i'm a sm-med or 6-8. my sizing varies widely at retailer and this was a perfect medium fit.  adorable with jeans or shorts. or dress up with suit or pencil skirt.  i have the blue/green.
0,The fit on these is frustrating. with l space you almost have to try everything on first because the sizing is different from one cut to the other. i wear a 25/26 jean and a medium in this bottom still felt and looked too small.
0,Love the fabric and it seemed warmed. but as other reviewers mentioned  the neckline was awkward.
0,This top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy. however  if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute. i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough. i wish that it had worked because it is so unique.
1,Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well  definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!
-1,I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.
0,"I was so excited to get this dress; i ordered the red  and it's a beautiful  vibrant  festive color. i am small-busted  5'3"" and 120 lbs  and i got the regular xs  which fit very well  fitted but not too tight. i normally order petite  but i wanted the dress to hit a little lower on me than on the model; it ended up just above my knee  and i was happy with that. the shape is very flattering and i really like the scallop detail on the back v. the fabric looks substantial but isn't super heavy? an"
0,"......not for the long waisted. i immediately ordered this top when i saw it online. the embroidery is beuatiful (although it will require extra care). the soft lavendar color was a breathe of fresh air. however  i felt like i was wearing a maternity top as it hung oddly on my slim  5'9"" frame. i am long waisted so perhaps petites will find this top works for them. i agree with the other reviewer that indicated the arm openings are a bit large and deep. sadly  this one went back...."
-1,I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
0,I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.
0,In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges  which looks rather cheap and sloppy.
0,"I have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving. the fit for me  however  is totally wrong. for reference  i'm 32dd  5'8""  140 lbs  and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms. the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy. the quality felt like it was lacking  too. the material felt like it would pill easily. order with caution."
1,I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots  the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
0,This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch  the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all  so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality  i would definitely look into other items from this brand  but back this dress went.
-1,"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures  but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined  so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin  unlined jacket  why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse  the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)"
-1,I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived  the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
-1,I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt  even with the xs size. however  i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny  as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.
1,This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down  as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!
1,I love this dress. i'd get it in both colors if i could! the cut and fit is beautiful  i'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it's too boxy or lacks shape. the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( #1 thing to look for in a dress ;) ) and it's just overall a classic pretty dress. my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isn't incredibly delicate like
0,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.  2. i like the regular hyphen chinos and the stet chinos  but these pleated ones looked like clown pants because the pleats widen the hips and the ankle cuff is very tight compared to the regular hyphen chinos.  3. i hated the mustard color. not flattering to me at all."
1,I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it  found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.
-1,Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so  i have bought 3 new pairs  and all have been so disappointing. first of all  the quality is horrible now. in the past  they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also  pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened  pilcro?!?!?
0,I wanted to love this shirt. it's got a thicker material  a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top. however when i put this on  it just looked like it was ill-fitting over the chest. i think if the pull was below the chest  it would be much better.
1,The color of this dress is sublime. so is the fit. ruching in all the right places. made me feel glamorous. it's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat  vest  or cropped jacket. the material feels so nice against the skin too. it's a must have.
0,This top did not look at all like it did on the model. i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose. great for someone who is pregnant. which i am not.  returning.
1,This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms  2 buttons popped off!
-1,This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.
-1,The material was thin  showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.
1,I love this dress. as a petite woman  it's hard for my to find maxi-dresses that aren't terribly long and that cut in the right places. this dress fits perfectly! i love the slits in the side that allow for a flowy look and make it easy to walk around. there is also an elastic band that helps the materials over the bust stay in place along your torso. if you a bustier person like myself  it will likely cut in just under your bust line as opposed to as your waist like on the model. since i am bus
1,This is the most intricate  delicate  beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue  coppery brown  and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin  dark hair  and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug  especially on my hips  and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give  so i would say with any curves  size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!
1,I have had this dress for a few months now and find it is super comfortable for the hot weather and can go dressy or casual with the right accessories. it does run large in xxs; the xxs petite fit a little better by was way too short for me. even better is that you can wash on the super gentle cycle and lay flat to dry. yes it says dry clean only  but its is made of cupro and you should be able to wash that material. i have washed mine several times and it has never shrunk or lost shape. the she
-1,I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in  it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.
1,This does run a little large  but it's light and flattering for me. the material is a very light/thin chambray  but it's also lined.
