-1,The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(
0,This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress  wish i had sized down
0,This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking  light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge  the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck  you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
1,This is a super comfortable and flattering dress and i get compliments every time i wear it! highly recommend!
1,I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.
0,I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9  140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected  making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed  as the color and concept were great.
0,The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.
0,I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.
-1,These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.     i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
1,I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!
-1,I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.  wrong.  the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large  same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.  the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.
-1,The sweater was nice but not as long as on the model. it was itchy also. this sweater was not what i had expected. their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash  sorry retailer. i sent it back .
0,I'm not sure if it was my undergarments or not  but the top clung to me in a strange way. the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric  the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms.
-1,I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really  truly adorable. unfortunately  the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b  ladies  so be warned!) at the same time  the arm holes were huge  i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise  you'll for sure nee
0,I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.
-1,I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.
0,Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
-1,I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews
-1,The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.
-1,"I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person  it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois (""shammy"" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik"
0,Material is very thin  and although this is apparent in the design  i just didn't like the way the cuffed sleeves felt...
-1,I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
1,Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs  but i am glad i chose this one. first  the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier  which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and  the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.
-1,"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar  sleeves  material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered  which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow  and be about two inches longer.    i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4""  140lbs and busty...a small was perfect  with the exception of the massive amount of material."
1,I love this jacket! it is stylish and is ideal for a casual night out
0,I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite  but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.
1,This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right  the colors are great  and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!
1,Love this piece. it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a t-shirt. i look forward to wearing it often.
0,If you have muscular thighs  like me  these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed  i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.
-1,I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on  the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair.   if you have a tiny head and pencil a
1,"I ordered these in my typical size  26  and they fit everywhere perfectly except the butt. for me  i found them to be too tight in that area. i went to the store and tried on the 27 and they were too big in the waist. i do recommend them though. they are well made  i loved the wash and the length was perfect. being 5'3"" they came to the lower ankle and that was fine with me. give them a try  hopefully they work better for you."
1,I started stalking this dress when i saw it on a store's instagram feed  and i was so thrilled to get it in the mail. however  i ordered it before reviews started popping up  and i was concerned it would not fit in the bust. however  when it arrived  the fit is perfect. it's not exactly loose in the bust  but there also isn't any pilling. the high-waisted nature was also suited to my shape. i'm usually between a 4 and a 6  and the 6 was great in this dress  and a perfectly joyful length--appropr
1,"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.    i ordered the small  and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy  with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on.     i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4""  the petite is the way to go. however  i am 5'4"" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a"
-1,Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also  there are no bra-straps holders  and my bra straps did show up a lot...
1,This dress is absolutely stunning and well made. it can be worn throughout the seasons. i love this designer and this dress is a masterpiece.
0,"I like design of the dress  softness and color ( i got grey)  the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6"" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality."
1,This shirt is very comfortable to wear  mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area  but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot.
-1,"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however  on me  they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste  and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus  back they went. for reference  i am 5'5"" and 125# and ordered the 6."
-1,"This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10"" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?"
0,I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it  however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...
0,"I bought three of these tees. i kept the turquoise one only though. the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad.      i love the style.  the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy. the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic (like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me)     now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab. i normally look better in more vibrant colors. the ""red"" i bought made me look like a corpse. it's not pretty at all. can't re"
0,I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so  when you wear the necessary base layer  the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea
1,I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color  and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size  but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!
-1,This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last"
0,First of all  the label on this dress is maeve  not nue by shani. second  i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny  which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall  i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.
0,Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
-1,This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!
-1,I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.
0,This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality  but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big.     the fit is tts  though slightly shorter then it looks on the model.
-1,Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased
-1,I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
1,I had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front  but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created. the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely. perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady. i have no idea what i'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though... we'll cross that road when we come to it  i guess. also - the interior seams are a bright  electric blue -
1,I find it very hard to find a dress. never like the way they look on me..this one???? fits like a glove  flatters my silhouette (which is difficult because even though i am at a good weight my waist is never small). looks like million bucks on me....i love it!!!
1,"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger  so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy  5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving  fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models  or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!"
-1,I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me.   made my curvy body look shapeless.  also had a button crack before i even put it on.  returned it.
0,I ordered the large since the med wasn't available and it didn't complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!"
1,"I am 5' 2"" about 118 lbs. thought this fit really well. very comfortable material. i wish the skirt was a different color-feels a little bland."
1,This dress ran large on me. i am a 10  sometimes an 8 but went with the 10. it just hung on me  giving me no shape. the colors are pretty and the dress was nice  but i expected it to wow me more for the price. sending back  may try again if the next size makes it to sale.
-1,This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal  but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit  the shirt is very beautiful in every way.
1,Love bailey 44. this dress does not disappoint. the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering. the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable.
0,The material is so soft and cozy. there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california. but  i ended up leaving the store without this vest  bc 1)the cut is slightly boxy.  2) every vest had different color variations. you definitely should go into the store to check it out. the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes  not an even vintage fade as shown. i'm so sad as everything else is perfect. fits true to size
-1,I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size
1,Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!
1,7 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant. went to a dr. apt and the receptionist loved this shirt. i told her it was non-maternity and she can buy it at retailer... i think she stopped by on her way home from work.
0,This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress  even with the slip  which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip  wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
1,These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.
1,Very cute plaid button down that is tts; i am busty and the l fit just right with enough room without the buttons doing the splits like most shirts. the dainty details & material of this button down makes this stand out from other button downs that look like flannels--which this is not. it is woven of a fine material enough to be able to wear a camisole underneath  it is not a flannel shirt. colors are vibrant and the purple in the back really is quite attractive. happy i got this on sale & sale
0,The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely  and in general  it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price  very disappointed.
0,This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture  the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture  even though the rest fit perfectly.
1,I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer  but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!
