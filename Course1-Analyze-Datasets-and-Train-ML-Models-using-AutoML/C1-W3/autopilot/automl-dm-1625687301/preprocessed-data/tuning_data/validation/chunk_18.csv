-1,I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.
-1,Material is hard to wear a bra under it
0,I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material  but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.
-1,I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.
0,I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay  but the orange is so bright  i couldn't bring myself to buy it.
0,Maybe it's just me  but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. i'm 5'7  around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give  but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe. the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model  and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the
0,According to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10  but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage  the one spot i don't keep any fat. i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12  but i couldn't breath with the 12 on. for reference i am 34ddd. it was the 34 part that didn't fit  the ddd would have fit fine  i think.
1,This sweater is beautiful  but is definitely more for looks than warmth. it's very soft  but very thin. i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned. i got the moss green color on sale  and i am glad i didn't pay full price for it--it's lovely  but certainly not worth $88.
-1,I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
1,This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.
1,"It's a nice casual dress that you can also dress up  but unfortunately it is going back. i got a small since dolan dresses always run large  but i usually get a petite. i should've known this wouldn't work. i wanted to love it because the top looks great  but the length is too long making the waist fall lower than i would like giving my middle a thick appearance.i'm thin  but i'm not skinny  5'3"" with an athletic build and a short torso with a decent size bust...if that helps. usually i can wear"
0,"I like the colors  material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6"" size 8."
1,This dress is really beautiful. the material is soft and sways  but it is sweater-like  not flimsy. it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout  but i liked that look. not form-fitting  has more of a drape.
1,I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online. i'm a size 2/4 (varies)  and i ordered it in a size 2. i've been searching the perfect  fitted  white  button-down blouse for weeks  and i love this top! it's figure flattering  true to size  and a cute  classy alternative to your basic white button down. i can't wait to wear it! =]
-1,One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.
0,I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
1,"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top  but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.  i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.  a great staple for your closet."
0,I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9''  150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big  the small too short and tight  but the medium fit well. however  the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment  and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in  how the model has done.
0,This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made  heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool  buy it. if not  pass on it.
-1,This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.
-1,I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder)  and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!
0,"I've had my eye on this for a while. went into my local retailer to try it on. tried on s and xs. it fit the same  not much different. the color is great. will go with so many things however i have a larger bust 34d-dd and am short wasted  generally wearing petite in skirts because of it. it sort of belled at the bottom  peplum""ish"" which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste. not flattering on me. i'm 5'3ish  118# and generally wear 4 in tops. it felt like it would stretch out as the day"
1,This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way  but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out  but it is totally worth it.
-1,"This dress looked gorgeous  light and lacy in the picture  but when it arrived  the ""lace"" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy  sequined material. it was uncomfortable  scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress  so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si"
1,The look  quality  and feel of this jacket is perfect. it does run a large so i would order a size down. i definitely worth every penny.
0,"I loved the actual design on the fabric. the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them  but the fabric was much too thin for me. i was surprised because another review said they were thick. to me  it felt like tights material  almost. however  they were not see through  which is great. overall  they just didn't look great on my body. 5'9"" size 6/8 curves  medium was a bit too loose."
-1,Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!
-1,Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture.
0,The dress is beautiful  i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it. it fits beautifully  and snug except around the arms where it is huge. i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat.
-1,I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi
-1,"I wanted to love this dress  but it has too many flaws. first  the ""waistband"" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second  the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third  i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side  the fabric isn't scratchy."
1,"I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully  i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference  i am 5'6""  145 lbs  34dd. also  the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said."
1,"I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0  (5'7""  32b  115lbs)  and whilst it is looser on me than the model  i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like  but i will wear mine partially tu"
1,This dress is gorgeous in person  soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe  but well worth it.
0,I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer
-1,I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow  but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.
1,I'm very picky about jumpers  and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have  i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast  don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)
-1,This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.
1,I love this shirt but it was huge! i ordered a small and i was drowning in it. unfortunately i had to return it.
1,"I am 5'0""  109lbs  32d  and the 0 petite fit tts. the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made. my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip. my dress arrived with a nude slip. i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing. the lace actually stands out. all in all  a greal buy. discounts make it worth it too."
0,So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small  didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine  has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(
0,These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!
0,I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it  so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top  just right along the hem  and then it's a hot  potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful.
1,"This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped. the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress. i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model) or black tights. the fit is true to size. i am 5'6"" and the length is a liittle low"
-1,Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better
0,"Loved the material  but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans"
0,I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work  and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad  but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small  or xs in most shirts  and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though  and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.
-1,I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer  but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.
0,I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes  this is a cute shirt  if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but  my arms aren't even big  and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(
0,I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe  but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately  i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long  so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't
0,Really wanted to love this  especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived  the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper  but going to have to return.
0,While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.
-1,I purchased this sweater in my usual xs  but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff  too  so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also  the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small  but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou
-1,Well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.
-1,It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
1,"I had this on my wish list but saw it as a "" on of"" on black friday....and it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect... if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer. it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing .... or as a regular cardi/jacket over first layer! the detailing is loely! even tho it is 40% off today ( i got it with the 25% off store wide sale)  my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did. just in time for all the christmas"
1,Several reviews have stated this dress is embroidered with a popsicles. it is not embroidered  but an attractive popsicle print. i usually wear a 2p and after reading review ordered an 8p. a bit roomy in waist  but with tie at waist it works. length great  but arm holes large. will have altered as this fit/flare shirtwaist dress is so flattering.
0,"I wanted to love this dress. i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model. however  in person this dress is cut like a sack. it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt  at least on me. it was oddly shapeless  even with the belt. it seemed a size too large. i ordered the xxsp. for reference i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs. i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c"
1,I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!
-1,I was so excited to wear this shirt  even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot  and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders.
0,This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher  not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.
1,Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.
0,I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan
-1,Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on  the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.
-1,"I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4"" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress  and once i did it felt so tight at the neck  as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons."
-1,The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.
1,Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy  and a straight style. i did size down  because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.
1,This dress rules.  so comfy  and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats  wedges  booties  boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either  i am a 34c.
1,I ordered the xl in the green motif. the shirt is fitted through the body. i'm a pear-shape so it's tight around my hips. it's cut straight down. i'll need to wear this tucked in or belt it/pull it up a bit closer to my waistline so it's more comfortable. the colors & pattern in the green motif are prettier in person. i love orange roses & haven't found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it. i used my birthday discount to splurge on this. i think it's over-priced for what it i
-1,I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.
1,So many retailer coats have gotten away from me. sold out before i could purchase. i bought this during the holidays when it went on sale. i did not want this the be the one that got away. so glad i did. the colors are beautiful  the sweater is really a coat. so it justifies the price. what a gorgeous piece to wear with all of my retailer clothes. length of arms was fine on me. i bought a large. i am 5 foot six.
