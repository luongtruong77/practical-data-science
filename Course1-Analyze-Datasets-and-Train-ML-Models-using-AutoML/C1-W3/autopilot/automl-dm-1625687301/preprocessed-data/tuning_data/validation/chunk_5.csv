-1,"I really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this ""dress"". it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on. i ordered the sm/med and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said ""are you kidding me?!""  by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look 50 lbs heavier. horrible design retailer. i don't know which dress the"
0,I want to love this dress. the colors and the fabric are absolutely beautiful. it is definitely a swing-dress. much wider than i expected...and i sized down. there is also a strange pooch in the shape around the middle. i am keeping it because i am in love with the the colors and print  and it looks very flattering when paired with a black denim jacket  just not alone.
0,I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed
1,"I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4"" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium  am 5'7""  150 lbs  really am large boned  straight up and down."
1,The material is great!! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one. everyone compliments them!
0,Plan to order at least one size smaller than you think  it's way baggy
0,This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy  perfect for a fall outfit.
0,I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium  following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame  but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.
-1,The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it's like not even the same dress. the neckline  color  the quality of lace
1,Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down  though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.
-1,Retailer has incredible service  and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however  this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use  so i first tried hand washing it. however  the black part of the dress came off on the white part  making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful  striking dress (that would be great maternit
-1,Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item
0,"I am a proportionate 5'4"" 39 year old and thought this dress would look great. it's a-line and looks a lot like the kind of dresses that usually fit me nicely. i bought it in an 8p  which is my normal size. the hips were a little too big  but not bad. the top part  however  was enormous. the cut in the shoulders/neckline was way too wide  the lace sleeves were way too big  there was too much room in the bust (my c cup was inadequate)  etc. this dress would look nice on someone who is thicker/vol"
-1,Agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape. unflattering overall. i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare. unlined and it itches!
0,"I ordered this sweater in green  and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length  nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however  it was just so  so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8"" and 118 lbs  fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored  since i've had a hard time find"
-1,I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f
0,I really wanted to like these. they're soft  long enough for 5'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;(
-1,Loved this online  but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.
-1,Although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it  it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found. the fit is nice but i wouldn't buy it due to the material being too delicate.
-1,Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!
0,I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them  i didn't love them. i love some stretch  so that part was good. however  the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here.       i really want to love them  though their light color has me less enthusiastic. another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect  which i noticed also. i might have sprung for them anyway  they do have a cute shape  bu
-1,I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.
1,I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow  this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back  the slightly puffy sleeves  the side slit)  and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot  so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?  34b  26 waist  36 hips). i know the price seems
-1,I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped.   it is very pretty but once on  it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust.   the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.
1,"This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person  especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower  it would look and feel less ""chokey."" i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas"
0,I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12  so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides  it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them)  then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol
1,I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store. we loved that this could be worn stand alone  with leggings  or as an over-shirt. it's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe.
1,I absolutely love this dress. it is super soft and flattering for my body type (petite and curvy). though  i wish it did come in petite  as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better. but that didn't stop me from purchasing as that's an easy alteration. very flattering. love it.
0,This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin  see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha
-1,I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately  i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.
1,"The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft  sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think ""oh my gosh  that's the one!"" but if you try it on  you will have this moment. it is comfortable  flattering  and slimming-a prefect everyday dress."
1,I bought this as a present and am very happy with it! the pattern is fun and i like the slouchy fit.
1,"I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple  but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful  rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles  but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet  so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am"
-1,Not as cute as photos  and too small in chest. i am 5'5''  125 lbs  and the small was too tight in the chest  and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable  and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.
1,These tanks are perfect for working out! they have big armholes so could work with a bralette but probably not a normal bra. the material is soft but they do shrink in th wash
0,This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on  it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side  gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also  it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
1,I ordered the medium  my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely  looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.
-1,Wore it a couple of times  it is cool and comfortable. washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray. i might get one or two more wears out of it. hand washed and hung dry.
-1,"Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings  i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said  ""that's going to pill up."" and i ignored her. and she was right."
0,I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua  but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo  but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it)  but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size  but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).
0,It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however
0,"I'll start with what i loved  this dress is made with a really beautiful  quality material. the material is gorgeous in person and the dress is lined which is really nice. however the fit is just so very strange. i am 5'6"" and curvy. i tried both a medium and a small (for reference i usually take a medium or large/ size 8 or 10) the medium was so large and too roomy around the arms and chest (i'm 34 d) the small was too tight. the v neck lay in a very strange way and i'm not sure it would have b"
1,I wasn't expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i didn't like it  i appreciate the design  fabric  and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...can't wait!
-1,"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c"
0,I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.
0,I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper  i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly  i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver
0,It really is a beautiful sweater.  the material is super soft and feels luxurious.  unfortunately  it just looked too bulky on me and accentuated my width.  maybe if i were taller  i could pull it off.
-1,"I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well  but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said "" [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric."" this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav"
-1,This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
0,Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath  but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad  just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic  but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms  but apparently i don't.
-1,Disappointing  back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?
-1,"But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)  probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires ""truth in sizing"""
1,"I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8"" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!"
1,This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers. so many nice details and a great fit!
1,This is beautiful. it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i can't wait to start wearing it.
-1,"I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4"" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me."
0,These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!
-1,"I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says ""cold water wash"". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!"
1,Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun  but not too much.
1,For a blouse this beautiful and whimsical  i just can't understand why the little button loops would need to be constructed to maintain security on fort knox. i patiently worked my way through the gauntlet of them because i was determined to try it on  but ultimately  i can't see doing this again for a pricey top that shouldn't require hard labor to access. the fabric is perfect; a beautiful cotton lawn without any sheen  which really brings out the contrast of colors. it is slightly see through
-1,This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person  the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also don't show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft  though. returned it!
1,This dress is really beautiful and high quality. the pattern  color  and fabric are great. the fit is flattering (i'm hourglass to pear shaped) and the size perfect for me in petite. please keep offering high quality clothes in petite sizes by higher end designers.
0,"I ordered this top in 2 colors because i thought it would be great with leggings. i always love my retailer purchases  but this fell a little short. i think it may be the type fabric it is  but the way the back hangs so low on my frame (5'4"") it doesn't drape nicely over my leggings. the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans  it would be ok. i returned them both to the store.  this is one that would be better to try on first..."
-1,"These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says  which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13""."
1,This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
1,This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin  but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!
0,I love the pattern and style of the dress  but unfortunately  it's doesn't fit quite right. the top is too loose (the clip doesn't work well) and the waist line of the dress sit above the waist. and the sleeves are tight (which is shocking to me because i have skinny arms).
1,Love this dress. perfect for spring and fall. great material and well made. lovey design. the dress has a built in slip.
1,I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long  like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo  but i actually like that even better.
0,This dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago. i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large. i usually wear a 00p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big. while the intent is to be flowy  i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to bag-like. while the belt helps cinch the waist  i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive. very disappointed as its such a pretty
0,This blouse is gorgeous  but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through  not the front  though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size  the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold  delicate cycle  hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.
1,"I agree with the previous review  i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is 2 hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat  it is quite short. i am 5'10""  135 lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed."
