-1,The top fits nice  but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.
0,So i was super excited to get this skirt  unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured  it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier  i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
1,I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect  a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo
-1,On the hanger i thought this had a chance  but oh geez... puffy sleeves  itchy  metallic thread  lace... what a mess. and thin. and uncomfortable. no  no  no.
-1,I got this in a l  and probably i am a m. however  the waist pretty much fit  but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust  but a small waist.
1,Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.
0,Really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms. i agree with the other reviewers  it's itchy  but so super cute. the sale price is a good deal. i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem. i got the xs/s  my usual size.
0,I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust  and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem  medium it is.
-1,I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing  but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft  the blue color is gorgeous  but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this  but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality  just does not fit a petite frame.
1,It's definitely not a $100  blouse  but i took advantage of the sale on sale and gotta say i love it! it's slightly sheer  but with a plain nude bra it's fine. beautiful details  very retro  light and breezy. wearing it to work and with jeans.
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
0,"I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however  sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1""  113 lb  and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end  i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t"
1,I ordered this top online. i had been wanting an off-the-shoulder top in a neutral color and when i found this one  i had to have it! i thought the price was great. when i received it  i was impressed with the quality of material. it fit me a little more tightly than some of my other tops  but was very satisfied with how it looked on my body! i got it in a size small. i do agree with others on here  the shoulders were a little more difficult to keep folded down...but overall...i am truly satisfi
0,"The fabric of this dress feels like suede  i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the ""but"": the dress is cut straight down  no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on  like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself  and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses  and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu"
-1,I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however  when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were  with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well  just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.
-1,Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
1,"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink  as shown. very happy with this purchase!"
1,Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!
0,I adored this suit - the style  the colors  the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much  it was practically painful! i'm 5'7'  128 lbs  and usually wear a size small  but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on  everything fit well but the length  though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!
0,"I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4"" (~118#). i guess i just didn't ""love"" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca"
0,This top is really cute online  but that's about it.  it runs large  but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
-1,I bought this dress because it was cute  swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry  the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.
1,I wasn't expecting much out of this when i was in the store  but liked the colors and thought i'd try it out. grabbed a s and xs (i'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes) - the s fit perfectly (tts)  and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit. it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue. in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me...falling low
1,This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness  i had to say no. i will watch for sale.
-1,"I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated  it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8"" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately."
1,I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.
0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
-1,The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
-1,I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric  and for a white/lightly striped dress  not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry  holes started appearing everywhere  both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest  in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget
1,This dress is extremely comfortable. the dress is slightly loose under the armpits  but the other than that the overall fit is great. can be dressed up or down!
0,I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top.     i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.
-1,I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
1,I saw this online and thought  hmm  no. then saw it in the store  touched it  and the fabric felt so soft. i am normally an 8 petite in cartonnier  but the only sizes available were 4 and 2 regulars in-store. the 4 just looked promising. i thought i'd try it on for laughs. but it is soooo cute i ended up taking it home. the 4 regular fits perfectly on my curvy on the bottom  5'2  145 lb figure. my measurements are 34(b)-29-38  and i was shocked how well this fits in a 4 regular! perfect length a
0,"I ordered this in a petite small; a petite xs would have fit too. fits just like on the model. i'm 5'2""  currently 33-25-37ish with narrow shoulders and torso. the regular size proportions would have been off on me. lovely pattern on a milky white background.  .  i'm returning it because it feels so scratchy  much more than a linen tee i got from retailer a few years ago and that i love  especially in hot weather. with this one i would also need to wear a cami under it  as even my nude bra showed"
0,"I tried this in a size medium. i have purchased several rompers this summer and that's usually the size that fits (i'm 5'4"" and hover around 130lbs). i'm short waisted. i don't have a long torso but this just fit. if you look at the model in the pic  she's bent to one side giving the look of blousing at the top  but if you stand upright  it's very straight and smooth. i could get it to blouse over the waist but then i had to pull the bottom up so high the shorts became way to short. i like the m"
1,"I love the color  which is eye popping without being gaudy. i am 142lbs  5' 4"" and got size 4. it goes beautifully on my slightly brown skin. the length is just above the knee and the fold of the dress in the front adds that extra touch of oomph. it does have wide arm holes so a bra  even a strapless one  could be tricky  although it wasn't a gaping hole for me. i think i could wear it over a green bikini-like halter bra and take care of the arm issue."
-1,I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch  but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch  you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.    first they started piling  which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before  and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f
-1,When i saw this online  i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw  the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
1,"This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase  and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try  and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7""  120lbs  slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short  but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi"
1,"I ordered this in xs  i'm 5'4""  around 115lbs  and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft  but not see-through  and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours  i'd buy more!"
1,This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality  and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area  even for me (36dd)  and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!
-1,This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull  no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap  shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on  because it was so hideous  when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
-1,The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.
0,This dress is such a crazy beautiful color  the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it  and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice  but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest  but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either  so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway  but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
-1,I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me  it was too much. wish it worked!
-1,Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed  i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer  i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter  especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit.
0,"This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however  one i put it on  i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also  the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down."
1,I've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now  and i think i've found it! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect. the material is soft  the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places. the sleeves are long enough  which can sometimes be a problem for me. the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long. i'll be back for more colors!
0,I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots  but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material  while comfortable  typically feels thin  but these do not and they are quite warm.  the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about 4 times. i have neve
0,I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean  i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress  just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.
1,Like all maeve tops of this nature  i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans  shorts  skirts  etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue  the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!)  and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops  but i do not have one in a color like this
-1,"I'm a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small. so  i ordered this in a small  and the top was a little loose  but it was way too short. there's no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public. i'm 5'7""  and the hem was higher than mid-thigh on me. the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape."
0,I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say  i won't be keeping the dress. the layers  fabric  and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.
-1,I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen  but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.    at first glance  i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy  single layer of unlined  unstructured fabric  to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt  i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim
-1,"I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress  i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy  itchy polyester-like fabric  not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black  not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly  i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'"
0,I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on
1,Super soft  light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future.
-1,"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress  especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash  it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also  it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup  but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and  for lack of a better way to describe it  cheap looking. the white banding around the t"
0,This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.
1,I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!
-1,I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
1,I am 5'3  120 lbs and i got xs petite. it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone. as stated in my review title  the material is quite heavy and great quality  which helps it hang nicely. cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional. love it with my lace-up espadrilles!
0,Due to the black sheath being out of stock in all sizes (for quite some time)  i took my chances ordering an 8p in navy which was way too big on me. i also didnt love the navy. i wish i could try the 6 or 6p in black but out of stock and wouldn't arrive in time for my events. sadly returning.
0,This is a cute top  but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors  pattern and soft material used. however  the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58.
1,These leggings are so comfortable and luxurious.  when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble.  they are comfortable and beautiful.  a perfect piece for any wardrobe.
0,The top falls nicely  great quality  the lace is beautiful. however  the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.
0,I really love this top  but am afraid i may need to return it  because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it  and they show really badly as black spots  because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads. it feels so good on though! you must be super careful with it. i have no idea how the little snags even got there!
0,Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.
1,This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!
-1,I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.
1,I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer. but  after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldn't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life! i'm 5 feet tall and a size 12  so this was definitely a maxi on me. but  there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats. i'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me. even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add
1,I just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes!!! there is nothing like a new pair of socks. they feel amazing no matter what you do. these are ultra soft and in-line with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom. i like the color black style (actually  i like all the new styles at retailer right now)  and i didn't think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on. the
