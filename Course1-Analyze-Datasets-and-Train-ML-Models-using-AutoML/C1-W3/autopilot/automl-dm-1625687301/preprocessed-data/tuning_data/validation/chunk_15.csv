-1,Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
-1,The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.
0,I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
-1,I wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice
0,"I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front ""collar"" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open  folded over  partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area."
0,Unfortunately  this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also  the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.
0,I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt  which emphasized my shape. unfortunately  it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me.
1,Got this in medium (5'6'  36c  120 lbs.). many of retailer tops i'm a small but this was a good fit for the m. got the white. not really see through but need to cut the side tag out as it shows through. i'm not sure about the other reviews - this was totally not boxy on me - falls very nicely and drapes slightly. a really sweet but simple tee shirt to wear in the summer. you can wear this dressed up with heels  stacked sandals or just with flats - ballet or strappy sandals. looks great with rolled
-1,The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short  heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it
1,I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small  but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.
1,I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings  so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived  i was equally pleased to see how soft  cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture  the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!
0,I really  really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty  and the front was flattering  but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly  i sent it back.
1,Love this top. work appropriate and dress down worthy. i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist. comfortable fabric.
1,I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model. but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews. well i must say  i'm so glad i did! i really love the shape of this dress. i'm heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist. the dress is very well made. if you order the right size for you  the slip dress will stay in place. i'm going to style it with high black platform heels  but i also like it with boots as
-1,Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
0,Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful  but it also stops the material from stretching  so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also  they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger
1,I agree the pictures are confusing. the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate. this is such a great dress! it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicer/dressier looking in person than i imagined it would be. i think it fits true to size. i either wear a 4 or a 6 in most retailer dresses and the 4 in this dress fits me well. i'm planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon! i definitely recommend!
0,Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.
0,I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately  i was very disappointed when i received it. it is  as a previous person said  very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy  and in my opinion  did not flatter my shape at all. sadly  i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic  or straight and slender  as you suggest.
-1,I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately  it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.
-1,I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size 31. i don't have stick legs  and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together. with the old pilcro material  this did not happen! this is a super soft jean  and although the fit was good  they just didn't last.
0,Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
1,Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store  it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand  and me being a more plus sized gal  their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops ..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color
-1,After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
1,"I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was  at least for me  a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude  there really isn't another word that i can use) and when you sat down  it is extremely apparent. i am 5""6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me  but again  i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle  it wouldn't ride up and look more fl"
0,"This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because  despite how much i liked the style  it just wasn't flattering on my body type."
-1,Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good
-1,Bought a large  could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure  this is not the suit for you.
0,Really wanted to love this top...it is beautiful with very good quality but...ran small and tight...also the bottom sides flare out as if it was stitched with too much material looking awkward...
-1,Got this in wine  very pretty and soft. but so sheer  even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.
-1,I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
1,Beautiful color for fall. sleeves are a bit long and loose  but otherwise a great blouse for work. i recommend sizing down
1,"This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large  and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is ""roomy "" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous  but a thin camisol"
1,Beautiful dress but i had to returned because the size large was a little big
0,I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress  the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me  and they
-1,I saw this in the store and was glad i didn't order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces  and this just wasn't it. no compliments here.
-1,"I noticed this top on one of the sales associates  and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible  i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8"" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material  it is light  and summery."
-1,"I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful  it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the ""orange"" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail  i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure"
1,This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.
1,Walked into the retailer store in new york  while on vacation  and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made  soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............
0,This top is lovely  but fits like a crop top -- and i'm very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don't mind the crop factor.
0,Unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my. i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ;). maybe it works better on somebody more curvy.
0,"This is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front. gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking. however  if you have ""shapely"" hips and back-side  this will definitely emphasize that. had to take it back. a little bit much for work and other formal/professional events. however  if you're less endowed in that area  it might work well. gives a great shape!"
1,"While the blue color pictured is stunning  i purchased the white poplin in store. two best features? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small ""v"" ( a great detail  especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months). next  this white fabric's crisp finish is coupled with a ""just right"" weight (solid enough to be opaque  but light enough for warm days). plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer. thrilled!"
-1,This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye?   i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced.
0,Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however  like others have commented  it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
0,I kept this top  only because i needed a plain black tank  but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
-1,As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
0,I love the design of this dress  but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn't cover my bra  and in fact  though the overall fit seemed right  the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i'm not large-chested  so this seemed like a design flaw to me.
0,I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me  they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.
0,I loved the idea of this dress  but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting  but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs  and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.  the material is soft  but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.
1,This is a beautiful  well made jacket. also  it's very cozy and warm. unfortunately for me  it was too short and wide. i ordered the petite  but it was still too wide which also made it look too short. not flattering for my small frame.
0,Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on  which is a first. was very cute in theory  but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).
-1,And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick  heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see)  and there is no lining  but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this  however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag  i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack
-1,Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great  but the quality leaves something to be desired.
-1,I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper  looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit  lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
1,I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders   it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders  and we'll endowed   but the large was perfect.
1,I love anna sui's lines makeup to everything. this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on  i couldn't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow. the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big. the hem is lovely scalloped. each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress  there is no wow that justifies the full price tag. now that it's on sale i'll keep it probably for summer.
0,I bought the white tee. while the print is nice  the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
1,"I'm a little on the fence about this dress. it doesn't do much for my fairly straight/petite body type; i.e. it's not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i don't have much of a waist to begin with. but the low v-neck is flattering and the flared skirt is too. it's just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape... i was fine with the fabric type  i'd describe it as a mid-weight ribbed knit blend. i'd say it's true to size  i got my usual xspetite and i'm 34aa  26"" "
-1,I so wanted this skirt to work  love the design! but  it's way  way too long... i am 5  5  116lb  and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
0,This wears nicely  and is true to photo. flattering in the waist  and on a petite  everything fell in the right places. i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric. just one design note - the tie is sort of strange. essentially  there's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone.
1,I ordered this for the colors  and modern geometric design. colors are as shown. a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans  and my burgundy flats. it's casual and soft enough to wear all day. i wore it to the beach  then out to dinner the same evening! oh... i spilled red wine on it at the beach  and couldn't wash it until the next day. i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots  then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out  completely. i air dried  and
0,I ordered this in blue  and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style  but i tried a few items on my last order  this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom  which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style  this item is good quality  soft  comfortable material  and a great spring or fall blue.
1,This piece is very comfortable and feels well made. it is not slimming.
-1,Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag  i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy  grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.    wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate
-1,I saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed. it is a lacey material with an under-layer  so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous. unfortunately  i did not like the swing dress cut  especially not in white. i wasn't sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother's wedding gown  but either way it was not working for me. to be fair  swing dr
1,"I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant  thinking  ""what do i have to go with this?"" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i'm so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the ""winter white"" trend happening this year!"
1,This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam  it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+)  i would foresee this dress being too snug. however  i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops  but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo
1,This dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees. the material is nice- not flimsy. i'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite  straight frame. the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless. i've never worn a shirt dress so i'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to look? i tried it with a belt but it doesn't seem to work with this dress as there's a band of loose elastic. probably would look better on a curvier bod
-1,The sweater could be really pretty  but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it's too bad  because the stitching was beautiful  but this item is going back.
1,I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review  it runs large in the armholes and across the bust  which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit  so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however  i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said  the detailing i
