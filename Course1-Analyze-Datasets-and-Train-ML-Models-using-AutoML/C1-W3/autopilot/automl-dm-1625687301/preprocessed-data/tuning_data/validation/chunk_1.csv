0,I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person.   as for sizing  i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine  although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue
-1,The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.
0,"I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs  5'5"" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!"
0,Such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress  too much fabric  it just hung with  no form around waist. it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received. dress was quite  a bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on.   sadly i have to return it. it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was very  thin.  recommend with caution to sizing.
0,I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well  but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model  it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however  that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit  and when left in  my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out  m
1,I was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking. per other reviews i took a chance...i love it!  so sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enough...but still casual and fun.  detail work is very nicely done.
1,"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt."
-1,It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it's brand new. it fits fine  but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible 
0,Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!
-1,I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.
1,"This jacket is a great fit and feels like a nice  comfortable addition to a professional/work wardrobe. it is very lightweight and fits somewhat loosely. i am 5""7 and 125 lbs and the small fits nicely. the only con is that there is not a way to secure down the top payer of the wrap )no snap  button  etc.)."
1,This sweater is lovely! i have worn it every other day since i got it. it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with. i have gotten compliments every time i've worn it. my daughter  who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear  said i looked like a winter princess in this! it is so flattering and comfortable---a winning combination!
1,I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.
0,I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.
-1,The xs was too large on me and i'm not a tiny person. while the dress was beautiful on the model  in person it had way too much fabric and fit rather tent-like. the fabric is gorgeous and the dress would have worked if it were more of a fitted style and had half the amount of fabric on the bottom. not flattering at all.
1,Loved this cute dress. so easy and simple to wear. i wore it with tan/nude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga. so comfortable. for this price it is a must have.
-1,I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.
-1,I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room  the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well.     i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co
-1,I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.
0,This was huge on me! otherwise i thought it was a nice top  slimming. i didn't bother looking for another size  though. i got a medium. i wear a small or medium.
-1,Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
1,This dress has a really lovely design and is very  very comfortable. it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped  and doesn't have quite as defined a shape as i expected. still  it's cute and i'm happy to have it!
-1,I had high hopes for this top based on the photos  but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it  almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.
0,"I tried yellow motif  but unfortunately  i did not purchase it.  it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me...  i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves.  texture was ok.  usually  i like a cool touch of linen.  but this t-shirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen.  i was not quite sure; it just was not right for me.  only word i could think was ""average.""  personally  i do not recommend it  but who knows  maybe it is right for you...  so  try wear"
0,I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet.
1,This vest is a stunner! the dark brown suede is so beautiful. the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest. it's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch. yes  it is a little pricey but it's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too. it's a keeper!!!
1,It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day
0,Got this on sale in black and red  and have only worn the black. quality is poor  seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.
-1,The button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(
0,I love this dress  the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled!   once i washed it (yes its washable) it looked fantastic!!!
1,I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it's perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes  big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it's really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score!
1,Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.
-1,I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper  the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper  so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper  i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???
0,This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.
-1,I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
-1,These pants are the perfect color  and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose  but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear  i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly  um  saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6  and since the pants are detailed as slim fit  i thought it
1,I tried this skirt on in the store  it fit like a glove (that doesn't happen very often for me) but couldn't find the right top to pair w/ it so i passed on it  but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet! so  i ordered it online  it doesn't seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store  but i'm keeping it regardless. highly recommended this skirt! fits tts.
1,Love this top  you can really fess up  i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds
0,Love the top. love the color. love the back detail. as a larger chested woman  the shape was lost a bit. but i just couldn't resist.
1,I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect  so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom  the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...
-1,The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
0,I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.
0,This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.
0,This vest is very nice and fashionable  very stylish. i like it a lot. however  it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however  the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere  so i could not imaging wearing this vest  it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
-1,The top is cute  but when i received it  it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side  the return was no problem.
-1,If you have any curves  avoid! it is not flattering.  the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.
0,I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but  i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim  this may work well  but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de
-1,The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas. in fact  that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t
-1,For a couple weeks  i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available  i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived  i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo  the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better  i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large  i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and
1,This is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time. i bought it after new year's with the 40% off discount. unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixed.  the quality of the dress is amazing. the details are truly unique. one could tell that the dress is very well made. however  it does run large. i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes! it's very comfortable and it could be dressed up or down.  overall  im happy with the purc
1,This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice  i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer  which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra  which too many of this design do. it is a bit large  you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.
-1,"This dress looks lovely on the model  but it looks just awful on me! i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve  it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space. the material is nice and the sequins are pretty  but the cut of the dress is unflattering."
0,I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.
-1,Generally  i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent  so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition  the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this  and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!
1,Kicky looking pants  that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight  boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice  fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids  but i guess i lied.
1,My stylist brought me the regular xs to try on in the store and almost told me i should buy it... the length seemed just fine  but i usually get petite so decided to order the xs petite before deciding... good decision  there is less fabric in the skirt  so it seemed anyway  so i am less overwhelmed buy the skirt. the cut is super flattering  and length was actually better (the longer sides hit  me around the knee). i wasn't sold on the dolor  as i have pale skin  but there is enough dark to com
-1,This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan
1,I love love love the fit in the corduroy  so thought about grabbing these jeans as well. they fit much pretty well  just the color wasn't quite right. i'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans  and these don't quite match the coloring in the photo. still debating whether to keep them. love the cuff styling and straight leg fit!
0,I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress
-1,"I'm 5'-4""  130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also  the straight across  rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown  not a hundred dollar dress."
1,Found this dress on the sale rack  but the store did not have my size. fortunately they were able to order & ship it free. the colors & fabric caught my eye right away. it reminds me of a vintage apron print  but in a good way. i'm tall with a long torso & i  had to lower the waist tie.
0,"This top is beautiful in the model shot  but average in person. it ran really small  i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest  and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also  the material is very thin  not so much that you can see your undergarment  but if you get cold everyone will know it. also  for the price  i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale  if you are interested in this top."
-1,I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style  but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded  and the trim of the shirt curl over  so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.
0,"I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5""  130 pounds  usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model  but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers."
1,A nice alternative to jeans  good fit. i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have. will look good with booties and full length boots. i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants.
0,"Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric  wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel ""well dressed"" in this top. i returned it."
1,This is a very sexy skirt. very slimming...a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe. dress it up or down. the slits are high  so you are exposed like a short shirt.
0,Love the knit  color  texture--but oddly a short and boxy fit...and so...not flattering.
0,This coat is so lovely  it is the embodiment of 1940's classic movie star style. the color  the style  the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe .... if only it weren't for those pesky buttons! like other reviewers  i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning  the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant. that same night  i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves. alas  i am as yet
1,I bought three -- in part  because they were on sale. i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though. they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less. that said  they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now.     i am typically a small  and bought x-small. the drape is not that different in the two sizes  but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size.     all-i
