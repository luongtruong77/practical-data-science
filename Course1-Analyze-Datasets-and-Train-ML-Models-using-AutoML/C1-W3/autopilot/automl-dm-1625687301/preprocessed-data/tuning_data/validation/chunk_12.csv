-1,"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress  the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people  like the model  but i would steer clear if you are a petite."
0,Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.
1,"Beautiful  washes well in a garment bag on delicate. has little clips in the shoulders to hold bra straps which is crucial with the scoop back if you have sloped shoulders like mine. i normally go for a large  but was definitely a medium in this dress. 32"" waist  32f bra    only minor complaint is that the pattern (at least on the red  though probably also on the others) is just printed on the outside and the inside is faded almost white  so since the sides of the dress are slightly longer than"
-1,I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
-1,The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
0,I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange  without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful  however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath  but it is so sheer you need something.
0,I got this dress in the mail  and while i loved the concept of it  it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist  it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting  and to me  made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good  but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot  but it would have still been a shapeless dress  just bigger. it does fit true to size 
1,Love this sweater! it is so cozy! i gave it a four because it does shed a lot. i have not washed yet but hopefully that will help with the shedding. i am hoping to buy other colors.
-1,I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!
1,This cardigan is so fun to wear. you can wear it like as it is shown on this model or turn bottom up and wear upside down as tag suggestion.
-1,This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
1,Cute top  a little less fitted than i was expecting.
1,This dress is exactly what i hoped it would be! super sexy and great material.
0,"I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i'm 5'6""  petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didn't fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it's so cozy."
-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.
-1,"Despite retailer's claim that they have ""fixed"" the button issue on this coat  beware. they haven't. i ordered this coat november 18th  feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed  because retailer indicated ""rest assured  this issue has been fixed"" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i'd get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle  i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di"
0,I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down  but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to  nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we
1,This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!
0,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!
1,Fun top for day or evening.
-1,This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l  so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge  i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large  and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is  it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge  hip-y  and bunchy. yuck.
1,Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i'm 5'7 and 135lbs.
0,This is one of the best potential dresses i've seen from retailer  but it needs a do-over. i'm usually a 12 in this style of dress  but i sized up to a 16 (the largest size) and couldn't even button the top. even if i had been able to do so  i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 5'5'' and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most small-breasted of people. that said  if the company were to try again ne
-1,This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple  black  stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms  chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
1,This looks just like the picture. it's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots. love it!
0,So  so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!
-1,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.
-1,The dress is too loose and runs too big
0,At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.
0,"I'm usually a petite  but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better  but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2"" and 105 lbs  but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry  it's a return for me."
-1,First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a
1,"I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs.  5' 5""  34 d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!"
0,"There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also  i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it."
0,This is a beautiful and warm sweater  well cut and easy to dress up or down. the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing  especially against wool or cashmere winter coats.
1,This dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model. the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color. i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did! perfect dress for work and going out. the petite hits me mid-thigh like in the photo.
-1,I can't believe how small this thing runs. beyond small. it's almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work  but there's no way it's going to when the l is actually a s. so sad to return this beauty.
-1,The colors are so much brighter than pictured. although the sweater is very comfortable  i did not like the color combination. i will be returning it.
0,Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!
1,I ordered this on a whim as i though  hey  i don't have off the shoulder tops let's try ti  looks cute...  i ordered the nude after debating  but glad i did  it is a bit warmer in color  and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft  not sure there is wool  i am not that sensitive to wool  felt soft to me.    size: i ordered the xxs as i think lately  retailer has been making things baggier  and on a shorter pe
1,This top is absolutely adorable  fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.
-1,The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through. also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.
-1,I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however  some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also  it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture  it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as
1,"5 7""   138 pound   73 year old grandmother. can't wear wool and always looking for stylish cotton/linen sweaters.  ordered m based on reviews. very tight across back and sleeves too short. loved the style  the below hip length  and color so reordered in a large. still waiting for sweater. hoping it fits better"
-1,Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.
-1,"I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit  very thick  rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky  the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2""  34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long  way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size  may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!"
0,This top has gorgeous embroidery  very very nice  looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl  i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust  and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering  because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
1,"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition."
0,"I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy  however  they are way too long. i couldn't believe these were a 33 inch inseam  but i measured them and they are. i am 5'4"" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i don't think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed."
0,I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere  more so than i thought it would be. but the neck  there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top  material is so-so.
1,This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.
-1,I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around  as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad  but it is going back!
0,I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i'm curvier on top. would be great for slender figures.
-1,In a sea of dresses  this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape  and ended up trying both the medium and the large  taking the medium home. it was super flattering on  and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.  here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving  i put it on  and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed.
-1,I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture  but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture  it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though  so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
1,I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight  soft  flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !
-1,The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.
0,I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but  the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin
1,"Not my typical sleepwear  but glad that i took a chance  as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings)  and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2"")  though fits like in photos."
0,Love these pants. ordered in petite . love style  great fit but so long .   keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches.   decided to order the black & green as well.
1,I loved this dress the second i saw it in the catalog and had to have it! i had been looking for a plaid dress for awhile but couldn't find anything that i fell in love with till this one. i love the front of the dress and the asymmetrical details. it's just beautiful. my only complaint would be that the back of the dress is pretty blah. after all the awesome going on in front  i was disappointed in the view from behind  but i still love this dress and will be keeping it and wearing it for a lon
0,I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!
0,I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however  there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just wasn't flattering. i love the design idea though!
1,These are so comfortable  it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort.
1,Love this sweater! great quality & styling. slimming and the side slits add a feminine appeal. pair with your legging and boots and enjoy the compliments.
0,I purchased this shirt in a medium  in the wine color. i love the drape and fit of the shirt. it has a laid back vibe and the material is supper soft and comfy. it is also a bit more substantial than some of the thinner shirts i've bought at retailer. you could easily dress this up or down. i wore this shirt a couple times and then machine washed it on cold on a delicates cycle and dried it flat. it majorly shrunk! now i can't wear it because the length shrank at least an inch or more. if you purc
0,As another reviewer mentioned  maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4  and while it fits  i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared  but also short  making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable  i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don
1,I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.
-1,This jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.
1,Love this sweater but it's too large. will exchange for smaller size because i really want it.
