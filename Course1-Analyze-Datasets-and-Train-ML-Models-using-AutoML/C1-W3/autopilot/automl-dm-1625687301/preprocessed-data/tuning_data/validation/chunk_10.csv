-1,"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4""  110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green  the red is much more red than rust colored  etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm  but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store."
0,I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on  the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.
1,T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.
-1,As a beach cover-up this would be great  but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.
-1,Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin  easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!
1,Love these pants. very flattering. not much stretch. the rear waist band is elastic with minimal stretch and not visible to others. they are long but wearable with the right heels.
0,Following the advice of other reviews  i ordered a size larger than normal  since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere  including the bust.  the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.
0,Tried on this maxi dress recently  hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.
-1,This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol
1,This top is a very comfortable  very easy top to wear. it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about. i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine. the ruffle lays really well down the front  which i was concerned about because of how busty i am. i ordered a small and it fits just right. i think the knit back really helps with that. very nice!
-1,I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy  too. looks so cute online but no-go in person.
0,Love the style and fit  but it does stretch out during wear. by the end of the day  it feels big.
1,Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans  i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough  you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft  super cute!
0,"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline  because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas  the adorable print  the handy bra-strap holders  and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb  small up top  not especially curvy but not straight either  and i ordered my usual 2p. yup  the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way"
-1,I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
-1,"This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4"". the large fit like a small on me  and not like a typical oversized sweater type small  but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight  and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the"
1,This top is very well made. nice heavy material for those in between days. the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside. i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area  but a little tight on my arms. still a keeper!
1,"This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however  there's no way that model is 5' 10"" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that  and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress  it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty  but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!"
0,This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami
0,It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft  stretchy  shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves. not for me but maybe for others. just ok.
0,Cute stripes and soft  but very pajama top like in feel/look... like if you wear it out  people will assume you've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home.
-1,I wanted to love these  they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
1,This top is way cuter in real life. it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on. the sleeves are split so not a warm top  but this will be a nice transitional piece. i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill.
1,I fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it. unfort they were out of the s  so i went with a medium. fortunately for me  this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large  i will still keep it. the material is sturdy and of good quality  the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy. great piece!
-1,I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.
1,Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.
0,"This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk  but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high  almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it  the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo"
-1,I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!
-1,I really wanted to love this top  but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.
1,Love this top  i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size. very comfortable and true to size.
0,This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also  the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath  it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you  buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.
-1,I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable  but sometimes it's still that horrible texture  unbreathable mess. unfortunately  that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big  its billowy  and cute  but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.
1,This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!
0,The top is really cute  but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.
0,"I'm 5'1"" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is."
1,Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one  so i ordered down. it can go either way  it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.
-1,I loved the cut and style of this shirt  so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see-through. if you do order it  get it in a size larger.
-1,I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
1,This is adorable and unique. i've tried shawls and ponchos before  they usually swallow me up  this sweater has that type of feel but isn't so much fabric. goes with everything.
1,I sized down from my typical size small. beautiful detail on the back. slightly sheer in front but dark bra or cami fixes that. shorter in front than back but not too short. goes with jeans and pants plus a shorter cardigan or denim jacket would look great.
1,I ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week  and this is by far my favorite purchase! the detail is gorgeous  it's very soft  and figure flattering.
-1,It's short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn't stick thin.
-1,I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however  when i received it  its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally  i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2  30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted  but its definitely not.
0,The design of this dress is very cute  but if you have an average to large bust  don't even think about it. returned  unfortunately.
-1,Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.
-1,I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.
0,I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape
1,"I am 5'3""  28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever  and love the colors."
0,I love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one (for my taste). 1) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs  2) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down  even when it's just on the hanger. 3) the bow is really cute but doesn't make up for the other shortcomings.
0,This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.
1,This dress is slightly tight on me and i usually wear petite 00 or xxs (5'1 100 lbs) the quality of the fabric is thick and texture  colors are just like the photo  and it has a nice satin like underlining in a dark navy. the snug fit of the dress makes it so i don't need a bra  which is nice especially for a day dress !
-1,The dress didn't meet my expectations  specifically the color  the texture  and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made  it just wasn't right for me.
0,Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering  and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size  oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt  and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits  would be a nice 3 season skirt!
-1,I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but  the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft  warm yellow. the fabric is a thin  sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on  i liked the idea  but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin
-1,The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.
0,I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however  like many tops lately  it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.
1,Love the way this tee looks and feels. so comfortable and fun! good length. perfect jeans tee.
-1,This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.
0,I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it.
1,I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts  half tucked  and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering  it is a tiny bit sheer  but i was wearing a magenta bra  so perhaps i am biased. overall  i think this is a good basic addition  to a summer wardrobe  can be worn with a nice skirt  or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs  can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs  with 30dd chest.
-1,I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy  cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly  but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it's completely unwearable. i'm super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer.
1,This top is beautifully made  but comfortable. the neckline is a stretch fabric and the cut is very flattering. the length is just short enough that it doesn't look like a dress.
0,"This top is cute  but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs  but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2""  110 lbs  34a). even worse  though  was the feel of this shirt. it's not lined  so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy  and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it's a pretty shirt  but not worth actually wearing."
0,"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful"
1,Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
0,This top is adorable and has a looser fit (as shown on the model shot)  so i would have liked to size down; however  the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down. if you have slim arms  maybe you could size down and make this work.
0,Purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself. it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work. the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering. the one problem was that when you raise your arms  the sweater also rises to expose your torso. it was returned.
0,Gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be. in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade. i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends. i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for.
1,"Although i find $150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater  buy it. i bought a size medium which fits me exactly. it is an off-white  which is what i wanted. i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt  for the ""sweater dress"" look. it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket."
-1,Loved the open shoulders  but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
1,I never write reviews and i do a ton of online shopping but i had to write how amazing this dress is. so happy with this purchase. totally worth every penny! it fits like a dream- the rouching on the side is so pretty and i love the full coverage at the top. such he pretty colors too. perfect dress!!!
1,These jeans! i tried these on  in addition to the high rise paige denim  and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother  with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs  but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a
