0,Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didn't hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.
-1,I bought this shirt in a l  since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone  unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy  but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.
-1,This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i
0,If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.
0,The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes)  but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though  because it's a pretty shirt and different.
1,Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store! the sleeves are not big
1,Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering  the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!
-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.
0,It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
-1,"The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it  probably size down 2 sizes. for reference  i'm 5'4"" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee...."
1,"I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it's a little longer on me  it's great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you can't see the color in the photo  but there's a sea green lining which is a cute touch!"
1,Loved this dress! material is soft... the overall fit is great! the challenge with this dress is the side slits... they do go pretty high... too high for church but may wear them with leggings as it gets cooler... super cute with or without belt 5'9 135 lbs and i ordered a small.
1,As all the reviews say it is completely sheer. it's a very cute top other than that.
0,I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however  it failed in translation for me  and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose  but the top clings to my chest (36dd)  pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large  since the bottom of the top is already to loose..
-1,The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra  no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top  because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package  it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated  it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the
1,Love love love this dress.  fits like a glove. beautiful details. amazing quality. i'm so happy with this dress and know i'll have it for years. :)
-1,Bummer  i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
-1,I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it  it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup  the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.
-1,I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag  as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge  everywhere but the neck.
0,The details on this dress were pretty  but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that  but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.
-1,After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
1,I love this blouse. the color is very cheerful with it's small white polka dot design. i usually wear a medium but went with the large because the shirt is slightly sheer and i will likely wear a cami underneath.
-1,There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
0,"I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3"" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?"
0,I bought this top in black n moss. they are of a great quality n love that u don't need a cami under. i do like them very much except that they're a lil too billowy in front for me. when i gathered excess material on the sides it looked much better. the black didn't look as large...black is slimming. i love the neck and the material. haven't decided yet if i'm keeping or returning.
1,Great dress that is very flattering. works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels. perfect for travel because the material doesn't wrinkle. would highly recommend this dress!
1,"I really love these pants as ""loungers"". not sure i would wear them outside the house  because the legs are very wide.. yes  the elastic has the problem that others have mentioned  but i just hold it in place when i pull them on and it stays put. but the fabric is so soft that i put them on every night after work and sometimes don't take them off before bed. pockets are a nice touch - something i have come to love about retailer pants."
0,I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.
-1,"The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer  but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4"" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size."
0,But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.
1,What a special skirt. so beautiful  great quality. i got on sale  but still expensive . . and it was still worth it. i will be wearing this for years!
1,First  i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic  but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and
-1,I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes. i bought a size small and the length was great  the fit was great  but the arm holes were gappy and big. i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise.
0,I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style  and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise  beautiful.
-1,I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also  there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...
-1,I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however  they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top  but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily  it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust  and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st
1,"These jeans fit pretty well on my petite frame  although wish they were more cropped. for reference i am 5'4"" 110 lbs. i was looking for frayed jeans for this fall and these jeans are on trend. i may look at petite options which would be truly cropped. overall they are very stretchy skinny jeans and have a nice dark wash."
1,I wish it was a little bigger.i kept this for it will be wonderful for summer.
0,Here's what i liked: great shape through body  cool empire waist. and good length loved the color  more rust than red. material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks.  here's what i disliked: the sleeves!! the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous. they are just too big and too flowy. they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up.
1,Love the color of this- a rich  dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy  not fitted. i ordered a small  then thought i should have ordered an xs - so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small  but because this is not fitted  the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.
-1,The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however  the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.
0,I bought this in the grey as shown in the photo as i'm not fond of horizontal stripes and i felt the striping would distract from the floral accent of this tee. the gray is light and as pictured in the photo.    i bought an xl and the fit is tailored  with some loose flow to it. it is not boxy or big on me.    the fabric is a soft  soft  thin cotton knit and very cool for hot  muggy summer days....esp. in the southern us where it can be pretty intense. since i bought the gray  it's not sheer  al
0,"I'm 5'9"" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite."
0,The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.
-1,I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
-1,I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky  loose fitting  professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.
0,Ordered size 12  it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long  hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color  nice fabric  great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.
-1,This is more of a sleep shirt. the fabric is too thin and see through. a camisole would not look good under it. will be returning it.
-1,The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.
1,I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over  and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top
1,Dolan is my go to for comfy  pretty  practical dresses. i'm 5'0 125 lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color  but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.
-1,"The print  colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely. the design is quirky to say the least. i ordered a small  as i usually do. i am 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket. it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist. it's not flattering at all."
0,Gorgeous top but runs large  especially in the arm holes.
-1,Like the previous review said  i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin  when i put it on  it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly  this is going back.
1,I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.
1,This vest is adorable! i love the color  it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great  some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly  i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall  but it works perfectly with my build.
-1,"At 5'4""  i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer  but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however  there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this!"
1,I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.
0,Thought i would love this product  but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.
-1,So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.
1,I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape  but when i put on the green one  i didn't want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much  i purchased the blue as well. love  love  love!
0,The collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste. the color and fabric is really nice. just wish the collar was different.
-1,I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors  weight  fabric. love. love. love.   unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers  the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite  which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end  i had to pass.
0,The material is soft and the pattern is pretty  but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting  with some stretch and a zipper  because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall  very slender ladies  this will be pretty  as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top)  but it went right back into the bag without a thought.
1,I thought this dress was lovely on. i'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale.
0,This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs  however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits  but something to be aware of.
1,First time trying pilcro  but glad i did. these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short. love love!
0,The material of the shirt and the ties are two different materials. the shirt is a very soft cotton  but the ties are of a more dressier material. i expected the shirt to be of the dressier material. overall it is a cute shirt  just not what i expected.
0,The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package  unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect  the dress hangs nicely  no puffing  no stiffness. however  the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the
1,The color  heft  style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.
