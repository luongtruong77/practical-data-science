-1,I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.
0,This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.
1,This dress is easy to wear  lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple. i love that it's so colorful. but for some reason  the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin. i'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful. i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust (although  to be fair  i am small-chested).
-1,The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.
-1,This suit was high quality  and a cute design. however  it is clearly made for a lean body type.
1,Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible
0,I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected  which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however  i did keep it because
0,This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in
-1,Hi  i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it's huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn't help.
1,There's not much to add to what reviewers have said. beautiful  flowing  light-weight fabric. flattering cut. gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery. a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up. this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer. you wouldn't find it anywhere else.  i've had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment  some of the embroidery is coming loose. it's gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t
-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice  the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...
0,I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest  but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape  it'd be worth it  but it's going back.
1,Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32  and delighted that they are roomy  even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict  but as usual  retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored  easy returns in the orignal shipping bag..   retailer design  fashion and company attitude excels!
0,I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work  but when i tried it on  i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through  and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return  unfortunately. if the top came in other colors  i would return for a larger size  but i can't deal with see-through work tops.
-1,This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem  loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad  it's such a pretty combination of patterns.
-1,I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns. however  when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didn't appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected. could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin.  also  i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am. i am a 36ddd and i normally where a size medium. a medium fit but like i said made
1,This gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes. the silk is light  airy and very delicate. the bodice runs large and the length runs long (i have to wear my highest platforms) but i would not return because it's an exquisite piece of art.
1,Really cute and very comfortable. material is thin and sheer. i wear tanks under things anyway  but especially in pink  you would need to. but love the style.
0,These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.
0,I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits  but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it  but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit  i will be returning this dress.
0,Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling
-1,This top is really cute  but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso. i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin.
1,I am 5'5  150lb  generally size medium shirt  size 6 or 8 pants and bought a size 8. i have had two c-sections so my stomach has some problem areas  which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit- not this one! i felt good  it hid my problem spots  showed off curves and stays in place! i can't speak to the durability of it yet  however  it makes me feel great  and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit. that in itself makes it worth the price! try it!
1,I like these jeans. when i wore them  i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size  but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on  but as you wear them  they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile  my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi
-1,I recommend this dress because it is beautiful  stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big  lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.
1,I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it  hoping that it'll fit me.     i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper.     i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress  i don't mind it.
0,It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy
-1,"There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1"". don't buy it. i know it's tempting with the sale price."
-1,The color  design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected  but as the owner of several deletta brand tops  i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes  and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large.   bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s
1,Despite being a knit  this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.
0,If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then  it's surprisingly fun to wear.
-1,"Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6"" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la"
1,In love with this blouse  i first got in ivory went back and got in black  you can dress casual or up.
0,This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.
0,I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom  but whoa... even when sizing up  i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable  and if you have a smaller bust  it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.
1,This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!
-1,Granted that i am not as reed thin  or as young  as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists  which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes  in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
-1,"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress  the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality."
1,I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy  but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape)  and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary  but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size  which helped  and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant  and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath  just bare skin   but they're so small that i don
1,"I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!"
1,I got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants. they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic. i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame  but i had no problem with these at all. i may go after the other colors!
-1,I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.
-1,1. this looks so cute on the model  doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants  but it looks cute.  2. that said  keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall  and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist  so more like 7/8 sleeves.  3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets  but this only comes s  m or l. the medium is really a size 10  which was too tight across the shoulders and
0,I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.
-1,These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color  but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.
-1,Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.
0,"The color of this is beautiful. i'm 5'8"" and had to order the s because they were out of the m  so it's not as dramatically long on me as on the model  but otherwise fit - sleeves a little shorter too. the m would have been better. but it is a little scratchy wherever it touches my skin  so it's not worth the $$$ to me. going back :("
1,I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them  this skirt is really that fabulous.     not only does it fit well and run true to size  it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on  and gives a little more tummy coverage. but not too much! somehow it hits me a
0,This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.
0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.
1,"This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy  so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available  but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2"").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence  go for it. totally worth it.."
-1,"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful!"
0,I love this dress. the design is gorgeous. however the bust is extremely small. only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size. i am disappointed.
-1,Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist  creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress.   why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.
-1,Legs are too wide. the fabric is rough to the touch.
0,"I wanted to like this top  as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store  i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2""  110 lbs)  and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality  but unfortunately in this design  that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing."
1,I'm keeping this dress but it's going straight to the dry cleaner because right out of the bag it has a very strong chemical smell... like it had been stored in a gas station. then  i'm replacing all the buttons. the fabric is a thick eyelet  folded over with these teeny  thin shell buttons that are a complete design fail. two were broken right out of the package. also  i'm a size 0 in most retailer dresses and this dress has plenty of room in the waist  almost too much space  but the top... i hav
-1,Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.  really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik
0,Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price
1,Love the cotton knit  for the comfort  but from a distance this blouse looks dressier. the embroidery adds a nice flare. personally  i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom  as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants. i found that it ran a little bit  but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway.
-1,Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico  but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
1,I'm very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy. it it absolutely adorable  and the classic plaid is timeless. as first reviewer said  the styling of this on the model does it no favors. it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering  forgiving way. the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section  then flares out on the bottom section. that bottom flare can sometimes add inches/pounds but this top does it in a very modern  subtle and flattering fashion. and the mater
0,I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw
0,I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!
1,Adorable! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit. i'm sure i'll wear this with jeans  as pictured  but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt.
0,I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable  but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
0,One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.
0,"This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering  it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend  to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would ""hang"" appropriately and ""swing"" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass."
1,Warm  cozy  can dress down/up  and is perfect for traveling. a great staple. as other people noted  the dress (if you buy your regular size) is a little more fitted than it looks on the model. size up if you prefer it to hang looser.
-1,I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately  they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up  i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.
1,I love the cold shoulder trend! this sweater is not bulky  but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish! it is not your typical sweater. if you want something unique  but still basic  this is your sweater. looks great with jeans and khakis.
1,"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway  i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs  5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft  nad looks like it may not wrinkles  which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute  but you can't really wear this untied  so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)"
