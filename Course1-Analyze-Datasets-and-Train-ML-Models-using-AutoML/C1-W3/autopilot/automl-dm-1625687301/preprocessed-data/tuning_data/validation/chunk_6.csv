0,The dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath. it was just too big for me even as a swing dress.
-1,This skirt has no closure along the slit. i can't begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo-you would be completely exposed. it completely baffled me
0,I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person  i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1  which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.
0,"I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail  but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso  and the regular is laughable for anyone that isn't an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4"")!  curvy ladies  also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely  the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not  and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would"
0,I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.
1,I love this dress! good for work or social occasions. flowy fabric  and not boxy. the length is perfect  not too short.  i can't wait to wear it. picture is accurate as to color.
1,Love this top! you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work. it can be dressed up or down  so it's very versatile. the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer. received lots of compliments!
-1,Well made dress  but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty  but the dress is too long  as well. as other reviewers have said  the front is too low cut  but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me  sadly  i'll be returning it.
0,"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size  but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee."
-1,I found this as a return in the store. i tried the xxs. i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger. it was so huge- looked like i was wearing an xl.
1,I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier  i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.
1,"I slightly balked at the cost  but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product  and it is made in the usa. in these times  that means a lot. 100% supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep v-neck  front and back and the slightly lengthened sides  very ultimate design for a tee. i bought the dark grey; the tag says ""wash before wearing""  which is one extra step... still  i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine. i bought the dark grey in medium  my usual ( size"
1,I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly  but is more flattering that way.
0,I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog  but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
-1,So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~
1,Fits well  comfortable and flattering. i wouldn't call this pattern fabric purple though. it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color.. the picture is an accurate representation of the color.
-1,This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.
-1,I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.
-1,#childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts  this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful  but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
0,Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%  which you don't see often anymore!)  great length  nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch  but as someone with a small waist and wider hips  i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure  these might work better
-1,Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.
1,I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.
-1,"The design of this sweater is odd. it made me feel very ""round"" when i put it on. the sleeves were wide. the other reviewers were correct in saying that it's a thick sweater  which i thought i'd like. the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected. it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater."
0,I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.
0,"I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11"" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs  the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally  this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas  and the waist tie ties way higher than"
1,"This is a gorgeous piece-the pattern and color combination are classic fall. the sleeves for a xs/s are slightly short (i am 5'8"") but the rest of the fit is great. with the type of fabric and poncho-style  i would recommend wearing something underneath."
1,"I got so many compliments from friends  i bought another one in different print. packs and travels well. i'm 5'6"" and a heathy 160 lbs  carry my weight in the middle. this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj's. also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra. living in a warm humid climate  it's my new go to dress. the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large."
0,I wanted to love this dress  the open back  the lightweight fabric  and fun print. perfect for spring and summer. it could be i'm too tiny for this dress  but the front of the dress wasn't flattering. it just hung and there was an odd tuck in the waist that made it look like it ballooned out under my chest above my waist.
-1,"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality  fabric was lovely  just a little sparkle at the hemline  scallops were great but i put it on  i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look  it just was terrible on me. i'm petite  5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa."
0,"I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0"" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about 4 in too long  even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo."
1,Love this shawl/wrap! was looking to purchase the white & warren cashmere poncho (but available online only)  and then saw this in the store. tried it on and fell in love. love that it's 100% cashmere -- super soft and warm. would recommend!
1,This dress is gorgeous!! amazing colors  drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested. i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work.
-1,I wanted to love this dress. it really has no style. i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung. i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight. had to return it.
0,This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere  however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong  or the model in the picture is just very very small. i'm 5'10  136#  36aa  slim built and the dress fits  but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer  bc it is super cute! also  the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa
-1,The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it  and was mostly white  yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.
-1,"Loved the idea of this - unfortunately  it disappointed all around. it's way too short and ran small. the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap. the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece. usually an retailer small (5""7"" 140 lbs 32dd) but ordered a medium (small would not have fit in this piece). do not recommend."
1,This is a precious! it's a little thin  as i prefer a thicker fabric. however  wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!
1,"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!"
0,"Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6"" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute."
1,"This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts  and the cut is very flattering. however - the ""white"" is actually ivory. not a big deal  unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not."
-1,The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.
0,Overall: soft material  cute pattern - but definitely a return as just didn't fit right.     fit: i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small. it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle. i've lost a bit of weight recently - so i'm more of a 36a  than 36b these days - but this wouldn't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad
0,I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.
0,"I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it  though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems.   1- it was to short. i am 5'8"" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it.   2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently  so perhaps i've gone down a size  but the medium was like a sack on me.   3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical.   4- as others have noted "
-1,Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!
-1,Dress is pretty  i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep  i am returning. :(
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.
-1,When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.
-1,I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.
1,"I saw these on the freshly cut + promo discount & decided to order my usual size 28 reg in pilcro. a great fit & appreciate the midrise. not too snug or baggy. look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt 1"" below my ankles. i am only 5'3"" so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but it's really ok. fyi - the front button & back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans. just love.. & love the price too! 5'3""  117#"
1,I love the look of this shirt. it is super soft and has a great draping quality. i personally love that the mid-stomach seem is see through  but if you didn't like that  you could easily wear a tank under it. overall good buy!
-1,I really wanted to love this dress  but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress  it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low  so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
0,I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place  which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off  immediately. i tried them on again a second time  still hopeful  with the same outcome. sadly  returning.
-1,I ordered this top in a 14  my usual size  and it fits fine  but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist  almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.
1,This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i'm wearing this do a spring wedding  even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - wouldn't that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!  note - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit  enhancing the lines of the dress - doesn't stick out  doesn't make you look like your wearing a dr
1,I love this vest! it is a great color and the inside is very soft! i will definitely be able to dress it up or down.  if you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneck/blouse underneath.  it's amazing! i feel so confident in it!
-1,I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model  but it was a cropped length on me :(
1,I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg  it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans  leggings  jeggings  whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.
0,Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.
-1,Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so  back it goes. and  i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!
1,This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly  i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft  and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!
0,Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight  allows no room for extra tummy  hips  booty  or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top)  but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m  would have definitely sized up  as i really liked the look.
-1,Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
0,Not flattering if your have large top. made well and very cute for thin no boob person
1,Bought these over the weekend and i am in love! they are very soft  extremely flattering  and the rich green color is fantastic. i may go back for the black. i went with my usual size 28 for reference  and the fit is great. these will be a fall staple  for sure!
0,Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front  but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft  but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look  but sadly this is going back.
1,"Overall  this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece  and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print  and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things  i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some  if not all  of the straps. other than that  i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else"
1,I was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful. feels and looks high quality and i can't wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos. definitely worth it!
0,I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl   wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full   a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.
0,This top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things. it was a bit short for me  as i have a long torso  but i wish it had fit right!
1,I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
